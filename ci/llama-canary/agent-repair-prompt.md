# llama.cpp changed-pin canary developer task

You are working on a trusted `main` checkout on the `family-certify`
self-hosted runner. Complete the llama.cpp upstream update as one developer
task. The harness has written the exact target SHA to
`third_party/llama.cpp/upstream.txt` and `.deps/llama-canary-target-sha`.

Read `.agents/skills/llama-patch-changes/SKILL.md` before changing the queue.
When the stage ABI changes, also read
`.agents/skills/llama-stage-patch-changes/SKILL.md`. Their patch ownership,
queue reconstruction, ABI, and validation rules are requirements.

Own the repair end to end:

1. Run `scripts/prepare-llama.sh pinned` and inspect the first real failure. If
   patch application stops, use the failed patch and upstream source to
   understand the refactor. Reconstruct the affected capability commits on the
   target llama.cpp revision, prove the reconstructed tree has the intended
   result, and regenerate the series with `git format-patch`. Repeating
   `git am --3way` without resolving the semantic conflict is not a repair.
2. Preserve every still-valid patch and make the smallest semantic changes to
   the broken patches. Keep the queue ordered. Do not delete instrumentation or
   weaken a gate to get a build through.
3. Generate model-builder stage controls through the Clang rewriter and
   `scripts/generate-skippy-family-patch.py`. Do not hand-edit per-family stage
   filtering or `begin_block`/`end_block` patches. Extend general AST rules for
   conventional upstream shapes. Preserve an exact `unsupported_shape` refusal
   for irregular builders until a sound general rule exists.
4. Fix Rust ABI mirrors, manifests, or runtime code when the upstream change
   requires it. Bump the prepare schema and ABI version together where the
   repository skills require that. A model row may change only when runtime
   evidence shows that its immutable manifest data is stale.
5. Run prepare, the complete patched llama.cpp build with upstream tests, the
   generated-family check, affected Rust package checks, and focused smoke or
   real-model reproductions for your repairs. Inspect failures and fix them.
   Keep build and test commands in the foreground. If you start any background
   command, record its PID, wait for it to exit, and check its exit status before
   returning. Do not leave `nohup`, detached, or still-running build and test
   processes behind: the harness must stop remaining process-group members
   before it can safely verify your working tree.
   Once those checks pass, return control to the trusted harness. Do not run
   an additional full family battery inside the coding session: the wrapper
   runs every canonical gate, including the complete roster, after you return.
   If it finds a failure, use the supplied logs to reproduce and fix that
   failure, then return for the next trusted pass. Report the exact checks you
   ran and remaining uncertainties; a focused pass is not certification.

The models are already available in the runner's `HF_CACHE`. Stay offline and
do not add Actions caching or download logic. Full family certification must
retain all planned single-step, chain, state-handoff, native draft, and
multimodal lanes. Package-v2 product coverage runs in the required pull-request
checks after the canary publishes a candidate.

Leave the finished changes uncommitted in the current mesh-llm checkout. Do not
change the target pin, create or switch branches, commit, push, use GitHub
credentials, or open or edit a pull request. Do not edit `.github/`,
`.agents/`, any file under `scripts/`, `ci/ci.md`, or this runbook. Those files
define the trusted verification boundary. Repair the patch queue, rewriter
implementation, Rust code, and model manifests that the fixed gates exercise.

Manifest edits are deliberately narrow. In
`ci/llama-canary/family-certified.json`, keep the roster, artifact identities,
lanes, execution policy, and every other field unchanged; only
`resources.estimated_model_bytes` may be corrected from the immutable GGUF
tensor scan. In `docs/skippy/llama-parity-candidates.json`, keep every existing
row and all top-level policy unchanged. Append exactly one classification row
for each source file missing from the manifest. New rows are limited to the
classification fields `llama_model`, `family`, `status`, and optional `notes`
or `unsupported_reason`; do not add artifact selectors, source revisions,
integrity records, or execution settings such as `repo`, `include`, `revision`,
`file_integrity`, `splits`, `recurrent`, `model_pin`, or `artifact_id`. A new
boundary-registered source must remain a runnable candidate. The trusted
wrapper checks these limits before it accepts the tree, and the full battery
independently verifies every corrected tensor-byte value against the pinned
local artifact.

Returning from the coding session is not certification. The trusted harness
runs prepare, manifest-policy, build and smoke gates; local failures return to
the same named session within the coding admission window. Once those gates
pass, the job exports an uncertified immutable candidate and releases its
runner. Separate jobs certify every family using the exact producer binaries.

A failed family pass or independent verification supplies its candidate and
confirmed candidate failure logs to a new session in the next attempt. Read
those logs before continuing. Runner/workflow failures and missing receipts
are first rechecked only for the affected families on the same immutable
candidate without invoking this agent; valid candidate failures from a mixed
pass are retained. Repeated infrastructure failure, corrupt/foreign evidence,
and other contract failures stop without starting another session. There are
at most three distributed repair attempts; every edit requires a new complete
build and family pass. Both the first full family pass and the fresh independent
build/family pass must be green on the same commit before the hosted publisher
can create a branch or PR.

## New upstream model families

Run the source rewriter across every `src/models/*.cpp` translation unit. A new
conventional builder belongs in the consolidated generated patch without a
family-specific rule or checkpoint. If it reports `unsupported_shape`, add a
general AST rule only when the activation loop and ownership edits can be
proved. Never use an architecture name or tensor spelling as the eligibility
predicate.

Source coverage alone does not add a family manifest row or trigger a model
download. Add or change a row only for an independent numeric, backend, or
state-pattern reason backed by immutable artifact evidence.
