# Skippy Model Package v2 Schema

Status: implementation contract for `feature/skippy_graph_filter_v2`.

The authoritative Rust types and validation rules live in
`crates/skippy-package-format`. Package creation, preflight, runtime loading,
offline conversion, and test fixtures must consume that crate rather than
declaring private copies of the manifest.

## Purpose

Package v2 describes the complete model inventory without assigning tensors to
runtime stages. A small JSON root binds the package artifacts, while a
payload-free GGUF carrier holds the complete model metadata, tensor directory,
and payload locators. A graph-derived `StageSlicePlan` selects exact tensor ids
after the normal model graph is built in metadata-only mode.

The package format has no model-family staging policy, endpoint ownership, or
cut-specific artifacts. Per-layer GGUF files remain valid physical containers,
but their placement does not determine whether a stage owns a tensor.

`source_model` records the immutable input distribution. Its digest is bound to
the declared primary source file and does not identify any generated package
artifact. `source_model.metadata_artifact_id` instead selects the generated GGUF
container used to construct the metadata-only graph. That artifact has its own
size and digest in the artifact catalog, so a packager may emit a small shared
metadata container while preserving the original source identity for
provenance and verification.

## Top-Level Contract

The serialized `model-package.json` root contains:

- `schema_version`: exactly `2`;
- `package_id`: canonical `sha256:<lowercase-hex>` identity;
- source and model identities;
- an artifact catalog;
- optional projector sidecars, typed generation data, and publisher metadata;
- native ABI and package-generator versions;
- creation time for provenance.

`model_metadata` and `tensor_catalog` are runtime fields reconstructed from the
metadata carrier. They are rejected if they appear in the JSON root. This keeps
tokenizer arrays and tensor descriptors in their native GGUF representation and
prevents two serialized copies from disagreeing.

Unknown fields are rejected. Schema evolution therefore requires a deliberate
schema-version change rather than silently changing the meaning of an existing
package.

## Canonical Package Identity

The package id is computed by the shared crate as follows:

1. Clone the manifest and replace `package_id` with the empty string.
2. Sort source files by path, artifacts by id, sidecars by
   `(kind, name, artifact_id)`, and publisher metadata by its typed fields.
3. Serialize the normalized root with the shared Rust schema.
4. Hash the serialized bytes with SHA-256 and prefix the lowercase digest with
   `sha256:`.

Validation recomputes this identity. Changing the carrier digest, a payload
artifact digest, ABI requirements, or generator provenance changes the package
identity. The carrier digest transitively binds its model metadata, tensor
directory, and payload locator plane. Enumeration order alone does not.

## Artifact Catalog

Each artifact has a stable id, normalized relative package path, total byte
size, and lowercase SHA-256 digest. Artifact ids and paths are unique. Absolute
paths, parent traversal, current-directory components, and backslash-separated
paths are rejected.

The artifact digest binds the complete file, including its metadata and tensor
directory. Tensor records may rely on that digest or additionally provide a
tensor-level SHA-256 digest.

## Metadata Carrier

`source_model.metadata_artifact_id` selects a zero-payload GGUF artifact. Its
file length equals its GGUF data offset. The carrier contains the source model's
normalized GGUF metadata and complete tensor directory plus these typed Skippy
keys:

- `skippy.package.metadata_only = true`;
- `skippy.package.part_count`: number of payload GGUF artifacts;
- `skippy.package.locator_schema = 1`;
- `skippy.package.tensor_part`: `uint32[]` payload artifact indices;
- `skippy.package.tensor_offset`: `uint64[]` absolute payload offsets;
- `skippy.package.tensor_size`: `uint64[]` stored payload lengths;
- `skippy.package.tensor_alignment`: `uint32[]` required alignments.

Each locator array has exactly one entry per carrier tensor and follows GGUF
tensor-directory order. Payload artifacts are indexed by artifact id after
excluding the metadata carrier, loader sidecars, and publisher metadata. The runtime rejects an unknown
locator version, wrong array type or length, invalid part index, invalid
alignment, or an extent outside the declared artifact size.

## Runtime Tensor Catalog

Carrier resolution reconstructs one runtime record for each logical source
tensor with:

- stable tensor id and native tensor name;
- GGML type number;
- dimensions in native GGUF order;
- optional stage-independent layer ordinal for physical grouping and
  diagnostics only;
- owned storage in one payload artifact.

Owned storage records use an absolute byte offset within the artifact, stored
byte length, power-of-two alignment, and integrity mode. Validation rejects
unknown artifacts, misalignment, integer overflow, out-of-bounds ranges, and
overlap between independently owned tensor records.

Tensor ids and names are both unique. Layer ordinals must be less than the
manifest layer count and dimensions must be non-zero.

## Sidecars

The schema currently admits one closed sidecar kind: `mmproj`. Unknown kinds
fail during deserialization. Sidecars reference artifact ids but imply no stage
ownership, and their semantic identity is the unique `(kind, name)` pair.
Multiple projectors therefore require stable distinct names; the package writer
uses each projector's deterministic artifact id as its name. Generation remains
a typed manifest field rather than a generic sidecar.

## Publisher Metadata and Live KV Defaults

Publisher files are package-level metadata rather than loader sidecars. The
writer accepts `config.json`, `generation_config.json`,
`tokenizer_config.json`, `chat_template.jinja`, and `hf_quant_config.json` via
repeatable `--publisher-metadata` arguments and copies them under `metadata/`.
Each entry records its semantic role, artifact id, source repository, immutable
source revision, and source path; the artifact catalog binds its size and
SHA-256 digest.

The writer derives only typed defaults used by runtime policy. It records the
publisher compute dtype and any explicit KV-cache dtype together with the
artifact id and JSON path that supplied the value. Common architecture geometry
in `config.json` is compared with authoritative GGUF metadata, and a conflict
fails package creation before payload artifacts are emitted. Weight
quantization and GGUF size never imply a live KV dtype.

Runtime precedence is explicit user K/V type, then the package's validated KV
declaration, then its compute dtype mapped to a supported live type, then
F16/F16. BF16 maps to F16 until BF16 live KV is qualified; FP8 declarations
also fall back to F16 until the embedded runtime exposes a qualified FP8 type.
Packages without publisher metadata remain readable and use F16/F16.

## Generation

`generation` is an optional typed manifest field, not a sidecar. It sits at the
manifest root, participates in the canonical package identity, and is rejected
if it appears in the sidecar list. When the source has no native
speculative-decoding support the field is omitted entirely (it is not
serialized as `null`), so a non-MTP package carries no `generation` key.

The authoritative type is `Generation` in `crates/skippy-package-format`. It is
`deny_unknown_fields` with two sub-fields: `speculative_decoding` and the
optional `request_defaults` publisher profile set described below. `policy` and
`thresholds` are not part of this manifest field and are rejected at parse time;
they belong to the packaging policy manifest, and the writer must not emit them
here.

`speculative_decoding` is a `SpeculativeDecoding` value:

- `default`: the strategy name used when a caller does not name one;
- `proposers`: an optional map of standalone proposers (omitted when empty);
- `strategies`: a map of named strategies. Each entry is an internally-tagged
  enum (`#[serde(tag = "type")]`, kebab-case variants) that carries a `"type"`
  discriminator plus the kind-specific fields inlined beside it.

The writer emits a single `native-mtp` strategy, and only when the source GGUF
declares 1-step native MTP support (`{arch}.nextn_predict_layers == 1` and the
`blk.<layer>.nextn.*` tensor names agree). The MTP layer index and window policy
are derived from the source metadata; the exact emitted shape is:

```json
{
  "generation": {
    "speculative_decoding": {
      "default": "mtp",
      "strategies": {
        "mtp": {
          "type": "native-mtp",
          "prediction_depth": 1,
          "layer_indices": [0],
          "window_policy": {
            "default": "fixed",
            "initial_window": 1,
            "min_window": 1,
            "max_window": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`layer_indices` is the single MTP/nextn layer (`layer_count - 1`); `proposers`,
the strategy `proposer`, and `window_policy.pipeline_depth` are omitted when
empty or absent. Unknown `"type"` values and unknown fields inside a strategy,
proposer, or `window_policy` are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`), as are the
`policy` and `thresholds` keys. Because `generation` is hashed into the package
identity, adding or changing it changes the `package_id`.

## Generation request defaults

`generation.request_defaults` carries reviewed publisher recommendations for
the package's exact model revision. It contains named profiles plus a selection
record with a default profile and optional reasoning-enabled and
reasoning-disabled profiles. A profile may declare the portable sampling fields
supported by Mesh, `max_tokens`, and reasoning enablement, output format, and a
numeric or semantic budget. Unknown values are omitted.

Every profile includes provenance: official source repository, immutable
40-character Git commit SHA, file, section, and a URL containing that exact SHA
as a distinct path or query segment. The runtime consumes this typed package
data and never downloads or parses model cards.

Request fields resolve independently in this order:

1. explicit request value;
2. deployment or operator model default;
3. selected package profile;
4. Mesh fallback.

When all higher layers omit limits, total output is capped at the lesser of
8,192 tokens and the context remaining after the prompt. Reasoning receives the
lesser of 4,096 tokens and half the effective output cap. Semantic reasoning
levels map to 1,024 (`low`), 4,096 (`medium`), and 8,192 (`high`), then clamp to
half the output cap. Numeric values are explicit and may exceed those
interactive fallbacks. `auto` selects the Mesh fallback, so enabled reasoning
resolves to the lesser of 4,096 tokens and half the effective output cap. Zero
closes reasoning immediately; `unrestricted` disables the reasoning-only cap
while retaining the total-output limit.

The resolved numeric budget travels through the public Skippy sampling ABI.
When the chat parser recognizes thinking start and end markers, llama.cpp forces
a valid terminator at the cap and generation continues with the visible answer.
Without recognized boundaries, Mesh skips the reasoning sampler and still
enforces the finite total-output cap.

## Loading Rule

The runtime validates the JSON root, fetches and verifies its declared metadata
carrier, resolves the runtime model metadata and tensor catalog, and validates
the complete package inventory before graph planning. It then maps
`StageSlicePlan.tensor_dependencies` to catalog entries by exact tensor id,
verifies payload artifact integrity, and reads only storage required by the
closure.

No runtime path accepts package v1 after the atomic v2 cutover. A v1 converter
is offline tooling only and may certify completeness only against the original
source tensor directories or an independently captured source-bound inventory.

## Required Follow-Up

Before production cutover:

- the writer, preflight command, runtime reader, and converter must use the
  shared schema;
- written artifacts must be reopened and reconciled against the exact source
  inventory;
- package certification must build the metadata-only unsplit graph without
  reading tensor payloads;
- v1 manifest structs and heuristic stage-selection policy must be deleted.
