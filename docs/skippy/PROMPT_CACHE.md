# Skippy OpenAI Prompt Cache

Skippy OpenAI serving has an automatic prompt-prefix cache for normal text
generation. The cache is intended to provide the same operator-facing outcome
as llama-server prompt reuse: repeated prompts, and prompts with a long shared
prefix, avoid recomputing the whole prefix on later requests.

## llama-server Reference Behavior

llama-server keeps prompt state in serving slots. With `cache_prompt` enabled,
each request compares its prompt tokens with the selected slot and reuses the
longest common prefix already resident in that slot. With `--cache-ram`,
llama-server can also save idle slot state into a RAM prompt cache and reload
the closest reusable prompt state later. No client cache key is required for
the common case.

Important llama-server properties:

- `cache_prompt` controls per-request prompt reuse.
- `--cache-ram N` enables RAM prompt-cache storage.
- idle slots may be saved to the prompt cache and cleared.
- later requests choose reusable state by prompt similarity or cache lookup.
- reported timings include cached versus processed prompt tokens.

## Skippy Behavior

Skippy uses the stage KV integration rather than llama-server slots. When a
stage has `kv_cache.mode = "lookup-record"`, Skippy records prompt-prefix
state after prefill and probes that state before later OpenAI chat/completion
requests. A client `prompt_cache_key` is optional; ordinary requests without a
key share the default namespace and can hit automatically.

Skippy records exact prompt-prefix identities and a small shared-prefix grid.
The exact path covers identical prompts. The shared-prefix path covers prompts
whose common prefix falls on the configured stride, such as a stable system
prompt or tool schema followed by different user tails. This is not arbitrary
llama-server LCP slot selection; it is deterministic prefix identity probing.

Skippy reports cache state in OpenAI usage and telemetry:

- `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` is the OpenAI-compatible cached
  prompt token count.
- `stage.openai_generation_summary` emits `skippy.kv.status`, one of
  `disabled`, `miss`, or `hit`.
- The same summary emits `skippy.kv.cached_prompt_tokens`,
  `skippy.kv.matched_prefix_tokens`, `skippy.kv.suffix_prefill_tokens`, and
  `skippy.kv.hit_kind`. The hit kind is `none` for disabled or missed cache
  lookups.

## Exact-State Retention

Recurrent and hybrid families store an exact-state snapshot: the complete
native session state, which is indivisible and includes recurrent and
convolution buffers. The stage byte budget (`prefix_cache.max_bytes`, or
`SKIPPY_KV_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`) is derived from attention KV metadata, so it
systematically undercounts those snapshots and a single snapshot can exceed it.

The exact catalog therefore treats that budget as a soft cap. It keeps a small
working set of snapshots past the soft cap, so concurrent sessions on one stage
do not evict each other on every request, and it never evicts its last entry,
because a snapshot that self-evicts leaves the stage with no exact prefix reuse
at all. A hard limit bounds that allowance and defaults to a multiple of the
soft cap, but it is not an absolute physical-byte ceiling: the last indivisible
snapshot remains reusable even when it exceeds the limit. Set
`SKIPPY_KV_CACHE_EXACT_MAX_BYTES` to pin the limit in bytes on a worker whose
memory headroom does not match the attention-derived estimate; `0` disables the
limit. Both limits are reported on
`stage.openai_generation_summary` as `skippy.exact_cache.max_bytes` and
`skippy.exact_cache.hard_max_bytes`.

## Host-RAM L2 Cache

Set `model_fit.cache_ram_mib` to a positive MiB value to enable the bounded
host-RAM exact-state tier for that model. The default value, `0`, leaves L2
disabled. Prefix caching and the node-local L3 cache must also be enabled.

Exact-state lookup proceeds from the in-process radix cache (L1), to host RAM
(L2), then to the node-local disk cache (L3). L3 remains authoritative: the
server locates the current durable manifest before serving an L2 mirror and
requires the mirror digest to match it. The cache worker promotes an L3 fill
on its second hit within ten minutes, or on the first hit for prefixes of at
least 4,096 tokens. Payloads larger than 64 MiB stay out of L2. A verified L2
hit restores the request immediately and queues the same payload to rewarm L1.
Rewarm records do not rewrite an existing L3 entry. Unloading the stage drops
its L2 tier.

`stage.openai_generation_summary` reports `skippy.kv.l2.enabled`, budget and
resident byte counts, logical bytes, entries, segments, hits, misses, inserts,
evictions, and admission refusals. Exact-hit telemetry identifies the restore
source as `l2` and includes fill time and whether the L1 rewarm was queued.

## Durable admission

After a stage has measured an L3 restore, local OpenAI serving uses that
restore-cost EWMA with the generation service estimator's cold-prefill cost.
New entries remain in L1 probation and reach L3 after two observed reuses.
Admission scores reuse probability and saved prefill time per exclusive and
fractionally shared byte. Under disk pressure, the shared node manager removes
the lowest-benefit inactive manifests first and preserves active pins. Before
the first usable timing sample, or on serving paths without one, the existing
reference-aware LRU write-through remains the safe fallback.

The L3 activity status reports `benefit_probation`, `benefit_persist`,
`benefit_lru_fallback`, and `benefit_evictions` counters.

## mesh-llm Defaults

mesh-llm wires Skippy prefix cache through family policy. For supported model
families, generated `StageConfig` values receive a bounded cache config with
`mode = "lookup-record"` and a production payload such as `resident-kv` or
`kv-recurrent`. This applies to normal mesh-llm embedded Skippy serving without
requiring users to send `prompt_cache_key`.

The default is conditional, not universal:

- unsupported or unknown families may leave `kv_cache` unset.
- raw `skippy-server serve-openai` leaves cache off unless the stage config or
  `SKIPPY_KV_CACHE`/`SKIPPY_PREFIX_CACHE` enables it.
- operators can disable cache with `model_fit.prompt_cache = false` or
  `model_fit.prefix_cache.enabled = false`.
- recurrent-state families use `kv-recurrent` rather than `resident-kv` when
  the family policy requires it.

## Benchmarking

Use `evals/skippy-openai-cache-matrix.py` to compare cold and warm behavior
across native llama-server and Skippy OpenAI endpoints. The script records four
rows:

- cold native: llama-server with request cache disabled.
- cold Skippy: Skippy endpoint started with prefix cache disabled.
- warm native: llama-server with request cache enabled.
- warm Skippy: Skippy endpoint started with prefix cache enabled.

The report is intended to prove cache behavior before comparing timing. Each
row includes a verdict, observed cache statuses, prompt tokens, cacheable
prefix tokens, cached tokens, suffix/uncached prefix tokens, and cache
efficiency. For Skippy OpenAI chat generation, the cacheable prefix excludes
the final current token that drives decode, so `cacheable = prompt_tokens - 1`.

Example:

```bash
python3 evals/skippy-openai-cache-matrix.py \
  --llama-cold-base-url http://127.0.0.1:8081 \
  --llama-warm-base-url http://127.0.0.1:8082 \
  --skippy-cold-base-url http://127.0.0.1:9337/v1 \
  --skippy-warm-base-url http://127.0.0.1:9447/v1 \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B:Q4_K_M \
  --output-dir target/skippy-openai-cache-matrix/local
```

Start the cold native endpoint with `--cache-ram 0`. Start the warm native
endpoint with `--cache-ram N` or the llama-server default prompt-cache setting.

The default benchmark pattern is `exact`, so the warmup and measured request
use the same prompt. To exercise Skippy's shared-prefix grid against
llama-server's LCP reuse, add `--pattern shared-prefix`. By default, the script
exits non-zero when either warm row reports zero cached tokens; use
`--allow-missing-warm-cache` only for exploratory timing runs where the endpoint
does not expose cached-token counts.

The cold Skippy endpoint should use a config with no `kv_cache` or with
`kv_cache.mode = "disabled"`. The warm Skippy endpoint should use mesh-llm
family defaults or an explicit `lookup-record` prefix cache.
