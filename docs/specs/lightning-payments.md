# Lightning payments PoC

This branch implements two-payment inference over authenticated mesh QUIC
connections, a provider-neutral wallet API, durable settlement, CLI controls, and
an initial Lexe mainnet adapter. Mainnet settlement was exercised on September
18, 2026 with two isolated Lexe wallets and a real Skippy CUDA model. The
validation results and remaining gaps are recorded below.

## Payment flow

1. Select a provider and send the request with its advertised prices. The caller
   may supply the ordinary OpenAI output limit. There is no separate quote round trip.
2. The provider prefills the complete model-tokenized input, then sends an input
   BOLT11 invoice with frozen prices, input count, the backend's resolved output
   allowance, and total cap.
3. The payer validates the invoice and reserves its maximum debit against
   the automatic spending budget.
4. After successful prefill, decode runs concurrently with invoice creation and
   payment observation. Up to `PRE_PAYMENT_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (512) tokens may be
   consumed ahead of the payment; the provider's payment gate then pauses token
   *delivery* until the payment arrives, fails, is cancelled or the invoice
   expires. This bounds bytes buffered, not GPU work: on the default skippy
   scheduler path, decode may continue up to the request's `max_tokens` while
   token IDs queue behind the gate. Output is held in a 1 MiB queue sized so
   the token pause is reached first. No response headers or body
   are released until its own wallet observes payment arrival (`claiming` or
   terminal fallback). Failed or expired authorization discards buffered output.
5. Authorized output streams through the ordinary OpenAI response path. The
   payer reads concurrently with its terminal payment reconciliation; neither
   ledger records settlement until terminal success is observed.
6. The provider invoices actual output transmitted, and the payer settles under
   the original authorization. No human approval is needed.

Both wallets start their pre-payment I/O during prefill. The provider wakes its
wallet so invoice creation doesn't wait on a cold start, and the payer reads the
balance that step 3 reserves against. If a concurrent payment settles in
between, that balance overstates the funds, but the wallet still refuses any
payment it cannot afford. A fresh charge then goes straight to the wallet's
`pay`, which recovers any existing payment by hash. The Lexe adapter looks one
up only when preflight rejects the invoice.

Prices and counts are the provider's claims. Proof of prefill, proof of correct
inference, refunds, and encrypted output are not implemented. Prefill before
payment avoids requiring blind input prepayment; it still exposes providers to
unpaid work. A paid provider must run a single-node text model. Distributed
inference, multimodal paid inference, and fan-out are out of scope.

The supported underlying endpoints are `/v1/chat/completions` and
`/v1/completions`, with one completion per request. Existing OpenAI callers keep
using the local proxy. Payments impose no additional output-token default or
ceiling. Omitted limits use the backend's normal generation settings (by default,
the remaining context window); explicit limits are preserved and may be clamped
to the remaining context by the backend. The former 256-token fallback and
4,096-token payment ceiling have been removed. Input remains limited to 131,072
tokens and requests to 1 MiB. Rejected paid attempts do not silently retry on
another paid provider.

The backend reports its resolved output allowance after tokenization and prefill.
That allowance is persisted and included in the input invoice terms so the payer
can reserve a maximum cost without truncating generation for payment reasons.
It must be positive and no greater than an explicit caller limit, if present.
Longer context allowances can require larger wallet/budget reservations; a
request whose maximum cost does not fit is declined before input payment rather
than silently shortening its answer. Only actual delivered output is charged.
The wire fields are unchanged, and existing persisted requests keep their
original terms. Older payment implementations still apply their own limits.

## Wallet and persistence

The wallet is a plugin. `mesh-llm-wallet::provider::WalletProvider` exposes
balance, recent transactions, invoice creation, bounded payment, lookup by
payment hash, and asynchronous `wait_for_payment(payment_hash)` completion.
`mesh-llm-payments` re-exports it under `mesh_llm_payments::wallet` and drives
it from the ledger; neither crate links a wallet SDK.

### Build defaults are not spending policy

Default CLI builds, including releases, include **payment infrastructure**
(`payments`): the ledger, budgets, payment gates, recovery and the generic
`wallet.v1` adapter. No wallet implementation or wallet SDK is compiled into
mesh-llm; wallets are external plugins. Compiling the infrastructure does not enable spending or supply
an operational wallet.

Without an available `wallet.v1` provider, wallet-dependent operations cannot
create invoices or settle payments. Free inference does not require a wallet.
A fresh profile uses `free_only` spending policy; installing or funding a wallet
does not enable automatic paid inference. Paying requires a usable wallet and
explicit spending authorization/budget. Charging for serving is configured
separately through model pricing. Existing policy, pricing, ledger and wallet
files are not reset by changing build features; pending settlement still needs
the original wallet to become available again.

Concrete wallets are plugin processes that advertise `wallet.v1`
(`mesh-llm-wallet::contract`). The host finds wallet plugins by that capability
and chooses among them as described below. An installed external wallet uses
the ordinary plugin loader; no Lexe-specific client API is required. Existing wallet pins bind both
plugin name and wallet identity: replacing a provider with a differently named
plugin is not an automatic migration, even when it uses the same seed. Switch
providers with `mesh-llm wallet unpin` (below), which refuses while anything
outstanding depends on the pinned wallet; do not delete the pin by hand.

### Using the Lexe wallet

Lexe is distributed as the external `lexe-wallet` plugin
([Mesh-LLM/lexe-wallet](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/lexe-wallet)), Lexe 0.1.24
on mainnet. Build or install its binary, then register it like any external
plugin in `config.toml`:

```toml
[[plugin]]
name = "lexe-wallet"
command = "/path/to/lexe-wallet"

[payments]
wallet = "lexe-wallet"   # optional when it is the only wallet plugin
```

The host hands it `payments/wallets/lexe-wallet/` as its data directory. The
process stays idle until the first wallet operation; startup alone never
provisions or contacts a wallet. NWC and BOLT12 are deferred.

The former built-in `wallet-lexe` is no longer compiled into mesh-llm; a
`[[plugin]] name = "wallet-lexe"` stanza is ignored with a warning.

When more than one `wallet.v1` plugin runs, the host picks one in this order:

1. The plugin named in the ledger's pin (below). A pin is never silently
   replaced; a pinned plugin that is not running is an error.
2. `[payments] wallet = "<plugin>"` in `config.toml`. It must be running.
3. The only running wallet plugin. Two or more need an explicit choice. This
   automatic choice is refused while any enabled plugin that might be a wallet
   is not running, because the choice is pinned: a plugin that crashed has lost
   its capability list, and choosing among the running plugins could pin the
   ledger to the wrong wallet for good. Start the plugin or set `[payments] wallet`.

`wallet_open` also returns the wallet's `features`: whether it can create
amount-less invoices. The host refuses amount-less `fund-wallet` invoices on a
wallet that cannot make them. Plugins written before the field existed get the
original contract's behavior: amount-less invoices.

Every `wallet_pay` carries the fee headroom the host authorized
(`max_total_msat`). A wallet that can bound routing fees must refuse a payment
that would exceed it; one that cannot still pays. Either way the fee the wallet
reports is recorded as spend. With a wallet that cannot bound fees, that fee can
exceed the headroom, and the overrun is recorded after the fact, not prevented:

- The day's spend can go past the daily budget. Later payments are refused
  until the budget recovers.
- The request's spend can go past its cap. If the input payment overran, the
  output payment may no longer fit under the cap and is refused, so the seller
  records the output invoice as unpaid debt.

Feature layering: `payments` (host-runtime, `mesh-llm`,
`mesh-llm-embedded-runtime`, `mesh-llm-sdk`) supplies the ledger, gates and
`wallet.v1` adapter. `mesh-llm-sdk` with `serving` compiles none of it; with
`serving,payments` it compiles payment infrastructure and expects an external
wallet provider. Apps can keep using the generic
wallet operator API while distributing/installing a wallet plugin separately.

Ownership: the host keeps token metering, output gating (host atomics on the
decode thread) and response bytes, and talks to the payments engine only
through coarse per-request `payments.v1` operations. The engine
(`mesh-llm-payments`, installed in-process by the binary or the SDK's
`payments` feature) owns budgets, the ledger, settlement bookkeeping, recovery,
invoice lifetimes and fee policy; host-runtime links only
`mesh-llm-payments-types`. With no engine installed the node is free-only.
The provider is resolved by capability, never by name, for every host-side
payment read: the advertised seller prices used by gossip, `GET /v1/models`
and the paid remote-HTTP check all project through `payments.v1`, the
periodic recovery pass runs against whichever provider serves the
capability, and reading prices never provisions a ledger — the builtin
answers from the ledger file when one exists and reports that it has no
payments state otherwise, so the recovery pass is skipped on a node that
never configured payments. An external `payments.v1` provider is therefore a
supported configuration for the operation surface the builtin serves. What the wallet plugin does: turn
wallet intents into wallet facts. Response bytes never cross
the plugin boundary, and no per-token IPC exists.

The host supplies every invoice's expiry (`wallet_create_invoice.expiry_secs`);
a plugin must not substitute a provider default. `mesh-llm-payments::lifetimes`
owns the values: input inference invoices expire after 60 seconds, output
invoices after 60 minutes, `fund-wallet` invoices after 24 hours. The seller
waits for the input payment to arrive for exactly the input invoice lifetime.
A payer cannot recall an in-flight HTLC, and the payee's node claims any HTLC
that lands before expiry, so a shorter wait would leave a window in which the
seller has discarded its buffered output but still gets paid for it. Aligning
the two means "the seller gave up" and "the payment can no longer land" are the
same moment; the price is that an unpaid request can hold a backend slot for
up to 60 seconds (paused at the pre-payment token cap). This also bounds how long an unpaid input invoice keeps a
peer blocked.

Receiver-side arrival is a normalized field, `Transaction.claiming`, set by the
plugin only for a pending inbound payment whose HTLC is irrevocably committed.
`status_msg` is display text and nothing in the payment path branches on it.
A plugin that cannot observe claiming leaves the flag false and the receiver
waits for completion, which the contract permits.

`wallet.v1` operations return structured errors with a kind:
`not_open`, `invalid_request`, `not_submitted`, `uncertain`, `failed`. The
host adapter (`network/payments/wallet_plugin.rs`) maps these back onto
`PayError`: only `not_submitted` and `invalid_request` become `NotSubmitted`;
IPC loss, timeouts, `failed` and unstructured errors are `Uncertain` and are
never re-sent. A `not_open` (plugin restarted and lost its open wallet) is
answered with exactly one re-open and one retry. `pay` and the `wait_for_*`
long-polls carry no IPC deadline; the caller owns cancellation by dropping the
future.

The host pins the wallet identity. After the first successful open it writes
`payments/wallet-provider.json` (`plugin`, `wallet_id`, `provider`, `network`)
and refuses to open a plugin or wallet that does not match, because outstanding
reservations and receivables are only meaningful against the wallet that created
them. `has_persisted_wallet` reads this pin; it is side-effect-free and never
starts the plugin. `mesh-llm wallet unpin` removes the pin so the next wallet
operation opens and pins another wallet. It only runs while the node is stopped,
because a running node may be opening its wallet against the pin; through the
running node's API it is refused. It is also refused while any outgoing payment
is prepared or pending, or while the ledger records any issued invoice as unpaid,
expired or not: the old wallet may still settle those, or may already have
received a payment the ledger has not recorded. Run the node on the old wallet
to let recovery resolve them, or forgive a peer's unpaid invoices with
`mesh-llm wallet unblock`. Unpin neither moves funds nor cancels invoices: the
old wallet keeps its balance, and a forgiven invoice that has not expired can
still be paid into it after the switch, where the ledger will not see it. The
old wallet's data directory is left in place, so switching back re-adopts the
same identity. Embedders can still inject their own
`WalletFactory` through
`PaymentService::with_factory`; without a plugin manager the service is
ledger-only and every wallet operation fails with a clear error.

The payment service awaits provider completion for incoming and pending outgoing
payments. A second method awaits the earliest receiver-side evidence that an
incoming payment has arrived, used only to open the output-delivery gate; it defaults to
the completion wait, so an adapter without such a signal is simply slower, never
wrong. Event-capable adapters can use native subscriptions. To stay within Lexe's
rate limits, the Lexe adapter implements both with one shared watcher that tails the
wallet's payment-update feed. Each poll asks Lexe's gateway for changes first and only
contacts the user node when a payment changed. Lookups by payment hash, including the
recovery scan's, read the SDK's gateway-synced cache using each payment's created index,
recorded from the same feed, so an idle node stays asleep. Lexe reports the arrival
signal from its detailed per-payment status. The method returns an
authoritative succeeded/failed transaction and must handle settlement before or
during subscription, support multiple waiters, and tolerate cancellation of an
observer without cancelling or resubmitting the payment. Subscribe before reading
current state, or use a replayable subscription, to avoid missing an update.

Incoming unpaid waits are bounded by invoice expiry; an already-expired invoice
gets a single authoritative lookup to recognize an existing receipt. Outgoing HTLC waits have no
invoice-expiry deadline: an expired invoice does not establish payment failure.
The independent 15-second recovery scan still reconciles durable state after
crashes or observation errors. Wallet settlement notifications do not require operator polling.

Each config directory owns a `payments/` directory (normally
`~/.mesh-llm/payments`). Wallet operations provision the wallet lazily; merely
seeing a paid provider does not provision one. The directory contains:

- `payments.sqlite3` and its WAL: policy, seller prices, frozen request terms,
  approvals, reservations, invoices, payment outcomes, receivables and output
  delivery counts. SQLite uses WAL and synchronous FULL.
- `wallet-provider.json`: the host-owned wallet pin described above.
- `wallets/<plugin>/`: handed to each wallet plugin as its data directory, so
  switching wallets never exposes one backend's credentials to another. For
  the `lexe-wallet` plugin (`wallets/lexe-wallet/`) it holds `seedphrase.txt`,
  recovery material persisted before wallet provisioning with the SDK's
  exclusive creation and private file permissions; the plugin re-asserts mode
  0600 on the seed at every open. Unix payment and wallet directories are mode
  0700. Protect and back up this directory; no seed export UI or
  encrypted-at-rest application keystore is added by this PoC.
- Process locks: one service per directory in the host, one wallet writer per
  directory in the plugin. CLI commands use the running node's API. When the
  node is not running, ledger-only commands (policy, pricing, pending) fall back
  to direct access; wallet commands (balance, fund, send, transactions) need the
  node running because only it owns the wallet plugin.

Payment intent is committed as `prepared` before wallet I/O and changes durably
to `pending` immediately before submission. Only prepared intents may be
submitted during recovery for the first time. Unknown outcomes retain their
reservation and are observed by the same payment hash, including after restart.
When the wallet has no record of a pending attempt, recovery resubmits the same
invoice, amount and `max_total_msat` through the normal preflight, fee check and
pay path. Providers must treat a repeat `pay` for an invoice as a lookup of the
existing payment (Lexe SDK 0.1.24 and later does, even if that payment failed),
so a resubmission racing an earlier one that is still landing cannot double-pay.
A rejected or again-uncertain resubmission stays `pending` for the next scan.
Once the invoice has expired and the lookup still finds nothing, the charge is
marked `failed` and its reservation released: nothing can settle an expired
invoice, so nothing was paid.
The wallet contract distinguishes `NotSubmitted` from `Uncertain` errors.
Definite preflight rejection and terminal failure close unused authorization,
while uncertain sibling charges remain reserved. Successful standalone sends
also release their unused fee allowance during recovery without needing the
original CLI or GUI caller to return.
Startup releases abandoned approvals only when no charge was ever recorded.
Live cancellation atomically closes pending or approved requests only before
charge preparation; periodic reconciliation does not sweep live approvals.
Prepared and uncertain charges retain their reservations.

Recovery refreshes input receipts from authoritative wallet status, including
zero-output requests. Output invoices require terminal input success; claiming,
unknown, failed, or unavailable input status preserves debt without invoicing it.
Recovery never reruns inference. Delivered-output debt survives provider restart;
KV state does not. No payment retry can replace a recorded segment invoice.
Receiving-wallet identity is pinned by the input invoice's signed payee key.

An uncertain payment the wallet has recorded is not released just because its
invoice expired: an in-flight HTLC can outlive the invoice. If the wallet remains
unreachable or a recorded payment cannot be conclusively reconciled, its
reservation remains held; the PoC has no force-release command. Recovery contacts only the original authenticated peer. Replacing its endpoint
identity while retaining its wallet/database is deliberately unsupported; unrelated
same-model peers are never asked to settle that debt.

Providers reject a peer with unpaid recorded invoices or finished, delivered
output debt awaiting invoice creation. Background recovery creates missing
output invoices in bounded batches after a crash or temporary wallet failure.
Admission waits up to 30 seconds for the requesting peer's recorded debt to
settle, refreshing only that peer's unpaid invoices. No backend starts during
this wait. The transactional admission check still rejects outstanding debt
after the deadline; claiming alone does not clear it. This covers the window
where the previous HTTP response finished but its trailing invoice is settling. Peer identities
can be replaced, so this blacklist is only a PoC deterrent. A slow or
interrupted payment is not debt: once the input invoice has been expired for
`INPUT_LAPSE_GRACE` (60 s, covering wallet observation lag), the request has
finished, a wallet lookup shows no successful or arriving payment, and no
output was delivered, recovery or the next admission marks it `lapsed` and the
peer is not blocked. This runs from durable state, so it also covers
disconnects, wallet errors and restarts. Repeated abandoned prefill is not
penalised yet (the seller loses the prefill and any undelivered decode). Expiry
stops new payment attempts; it does not prove an already accepted payment has
settled or become observable. If wallet observation fails at the deadline, a
payer can be charged for completed prefill with no output: an accepted
residual risk, not a no-charge guarantee. Lapsed invoices are not rescanned by
background recovery; a receipt that arrives after lapse is recorded only by a
later explicit lookup for that request. Delivered-but-unpaid output
still blocks, and that block is deliberate and does not clear on its own. `mesh-llm wallet blocked`
lists blocked peers with the full peer identifier and each recorded debt, and
`mesh-llm wallet unblock PEER` (the full identifier or a unique prefix of at
least eight characters) forgives that peer's recorded debt: unpaid invoices are
marked forgiven and delivered-but-uninvoiced output is never invoiced. Both are
ledger-only commands and work while the node is stopped. Forgiveness is an
operator override, not a refund; a forgiven invoice that is paid later is still
recorded as received.

Definitively failed inference payments stop automatic recovery attempts and
release unused payer authorization; provider debt is not forgiven. The PoC does
not retry a terminally failed invoice from the same wallet or replace an invoice
already bound to a segment. An unpaid invoice may still be settled from another
wallet if it remains payable. Never-submitted and failed attempts do not produce
an automatic refund. Sending an already-settled invoice reports its existing
payment without creating a new approval or debit.

## Prices, fees, and token accounting

The seller explicitly configures per-model input/output msat per million tokens
and a minimum invoice quantum. Free serving is the default. Charges use wide
integer arithmetic, ceiling division and quantum rounding at the invoice
boundary. Zero delivered output produces no output invoice.

Enabling `wallet pricing MODEL` without explicit rates uses 500 input and 1500
output msat per million tokens;
small requests at those rates usually round to 1 msat. A 1 msat accounting unit
is not evidence of economical routing: channel minima, routing fees and liquidity
can dominate. Validate amounts and receiving liquidity with Lexe on mainnet.

The payer reserves a routing-fee allowance for each inference payment of
`max(3000 msat, 1% of the amount)` (`pricing::fee_allowance_msat`), so a
request's cap is both inference charges plus both allowances. Seller and payer
compute the cap from the same function and the payer rejects terms that
disagree. The wallet is told the resulting cap per payment. A wallet that can
bound fees must not submit a payment whose amount plus fees exceeds it; Lexe
preflights a route and submits that same route only when its total debit fits.
A wallet that cannot bound fees may exceed it (see the wallet contract above). Route minimums can
increase the sent amount; that increase also counts against the cap. Actual
outgoing amount and fees are recorded. Operators can choose a different cap for
an explicit `wallet send`.

Input includes templates, system messages and tools, including cached input at
the ordinary rate. Output counts canonical accepted tokens, excluding EOS and
rejected speculative candidates. Streaming responses carry ordered usage
watermarks; billing advances only after those bytes are accepted by the peer
transport. Socket acceptance does not prove receipt by the end application.
Partial frames or a crash between transmission and accounting can conservatively
undercharge. Non-streaming responses become billable when their complete JSON
usage is transmitted.

Unpaid output delivery waits until the input invoice expires (60 seconds) or
cancellation. Decode runs ahead of the payment only up to the pre-payment token
cap, then pauses in the backend's generation gate; the 1 MiB queue is a
backstop, not the pause. If it ever filled, reads would stop and the backend's
10-second receiver-stall timeout would cancel generation rather than pause it. Settlement continues independently of the application's HTTP
connection. The provider stops further generation when it receives cancellation.
Late input payment after state release is recorded but does not regenerate output
or trigger an automatic refund.

## Approval and routing

Free-only is the default. Automatic policy enables paid providers when available
and pays without per-inference approval, subject to a positive daily budget and
available wallet funds. There is no separate saved payment opt-in.

For a funded wallet, configure the client once:

```sh
mesh-llm client --auto
# In another terminal, create and externally pay a funding invoice if needed:
mesh-llm wallet fund-wallet --amount-sats 1000
mesh-llm wallet policy --mode automatic --daily-budget-sats 100
# Use an ordinary OpenAI client at http://127.0.0.1:9337/v1.
mesh-llm wallet policy
mesh-llm wallet policy --mode free-only
```

`client --auto` selects mesh discovery, not payment authorization. Funding alone
does not enable spending. Automatic policy retains free providers as candidates;
it neither requires nor guarantees a paid provider. A request whose maximum cost
does not fit the remaining budget is not authorized. There are no mandatory
per-token price caps or extra setup calls. Seller pricing is independent.

Policy persists across restarts and mesh switches. `wallet policy` without flags
reads it without changing it, returning `mode`, `daily_budget_msat`,
`spent_today_msat`, `reserved_msat`, and `remaining_daily_budget_msat`. The latter
is the budget allowance, not a guarantee of wallet funds. Reading policy does not
provision a wallet. Applications use the same `policy` command through
`POST /api/wallet`; no second setting is required.

The budget uses UTC calendar days and actual settlement timestamps, including
fees. Outstanding reservations carry across midnight. Authorization atomically
checks unreserved wallet balance and remaining budget. Switching to free-only
stops new paid inference, but does not cancel already-submitted settlement.
Manual per-inference approval is not supported. Provider/model approvals and
price browsing are separate future features.

Requests may still include `mesh_payment` to **restrict** the profile for that
request (for example `{"mode":"free_only"}`). This is not an opt-in or a stored
setting: requests cannot enable paid use under free-only policy or expand the
budget. The field is stripped before backend or remote forwarding. Existing
remote-ingress restrictions remain authoritative.

Routing prefers local inference, eligible paid peers, then free peers. Paid peers
are ranked by estimated input plus maximum output cost for the exact model.
Existing capability, health and context checks still apply. Equal-price choices
retain cache/observed-performance preferences. No universal throughput floor is
introduced. The invoice supplies the actual input charge before authorization.

Only loopback-originated requests can spend. QUIC ingress does not gain wallet
access. Paid routing and management wallet routes both require trusted-local
Host/Origin checks, including for browser simple POSTs with `text/plain` JSON
bodies. Native clients without an Origin header remain supported. Wallet-enabled
nodes refuse the provenance-losing legacy TCP bridge;
normal direct QUIC ingress still supports free inference. A process-owned socket
registry also preserves remote origin for existing legacy connections if wallet
or seller configuration changes while a connection is open. Non-loopback TCP
callers likewise cannot bypass seller charges.

The legacy TCP bridge is the older inbound path for embedders that register a
loopback port instead of installing direct ingress (`tunnel.rs`). On a node
with seller prices, a persisted wallet or a live wallet, requests arriving over
it get HTTP 402 (`inbound_http.rs`, `legacy_bridge_requires_payment_ingress`);
free nodes and builds without the `payments` feature are unchanged. Embedders
that need paid serving must install direct ingress. Wallet API requests can
bind an expected runtime PID and config directory to reject stale destinations.

Pricing gossip is additive (protobuf field 51 and optional JSON metadata). Older
nodes ignore it, while paid providers reject unpaid ordinary remote inference
with HTTP 402. Free nodes retain the existing mesh ALPNs. Live interoperability
with released v0.76.1 was verified in both directions; see the follow-up results
below. This does not certify every older release.

## CLI and application API

```sh
mesh-llm wallet get-balance
mesh-llm wallet get-transactions --limit 20
mesh-llm wallet fund-wallet
mesh-llm wallet fund-wallet --amount-sats 10000
mesh-llm wallet send lnbc... --max-fee-msat 1000
mesh-llm wallet send lnbc... --amount-msat 10000 --max-fee-msat 1000
mesh-llm wallet pending
mesh-llm wallet blocked
mesh-llm wallet unblock PEER_ID
mesh-llm wallet unpin
mesh-llm wallet policy --mode automatic --daily-budget-sats 100
mesh-llm wallet policy --mode free-only
mesh-llm wallet pricing MODEL --input-msat-per-million 500 --output-msat-per-million 1500
mesh-llm wallet pricing MODEL --free
```

`balance`, `transactions`, and `fund` are aliases. `wallet --port PORT` selects
the management port. An explicit global `--config PATH` binds the CLI to that
config directory. Wallet policy lives in the payment ledger, not config.toml;
it persists across engine restarts and mesh switches.

Applications POST JSON to `/api/wallet` on the local management port:

```json
{"command":"balance","expected_pid":12345}
```

Commands are `balance`, `transactions` (`limit`), `fund`, `inspect_invoice`
(`invoice`), `send` (`invoice`, optional `amount_msat`, `max_fee_msat`), `pending`,
`blocked`, `unblock` (`peer`), `unpin`, `policy` (optional `value`), `pricing`, and
`set_pricing`
(`model`, nullable `value`). `expected_pid` and `expected_directory` are optional
local destination checks. The balance response exposes `spendable_msat` and
`available_for_inference_msat` after policy and reservations. `pending` returns
durable request records, including completed history; filter `state="pending"`
when inspecting unfinished work. Transactions and invoices use provider-neutral JSON types.

The [companion mesh-app fork](https://github.com/benthecarman/mesh-app/tree/lightning-wallet)
adds native Wallet menu controls for balance,
funding, sending and history. Its earlier manual-approval controls need updating
to this branch’s free-only/automatic policy. It uses
this API and the retained engine PID, with network calls off the UI thread. It
requires this branch's engine; the previously pinned released engine lacks these
routes. It does not embed a second wallet or SDK.

## Validation and operator mainnet runbook

After removing payment-specific output limits, validation passed 34 wallet tests,
16 focused host payment tests, all-target Clippy, and `just build cpu`. The host
tests use real QUIC peers with simulated wallets/backends: omitted limits and an
explicit 65,536-token ceiling both resolve to a 6,000-token backend allowance and
settle 5,000 actual output tokens. Ledger coverage verifies the resolved allowance
survives restart and rejects excess delivery accounting. No mainnet payments were
made for this change.

Prior baseline validation completed: `just build cpu`, 3,581 host unit tests (11 ignored),
24 wallet tests, ten focused host payment tests, the opt-in native model
test, all-target Clippy, and the publish/crate-list/console-print consistency
checks. Desktop `just verify` and native fixture interactions also passed.

Local checks cover invoice substitution, pricing/overflow, concurrent
reservations, restart recovery after an uncertain send, duplicate segment/hash
rejection, two actual QUIC peers with simulated wallets (automatic, manual approval and
cancellation settlement), and native-model prefill
suspension before decode. These do not prove mainnet routing or Lexe availability.

### Mainnet results, September 18, 2026

Two isolated nodes on Ubuntu 26.04 used Lexe mainnet and a private QUIC mesh.
The provider served `Qwen3.8-27B-Lightning` from the Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M GGUF on
an RTX 5090 through embedded Skippy. The payer had a 100-sat test spending cap.
Input/output prices were 10,000,000/30,000,000 msat per million tokens, with a
1,000-msat invoice quantum. These are test rates, not new defaults.

- Manual approval withheld application output until authorization. Input and
  output invoices both settled and matched the provider's receipts.
- Automatic non-streaming inference settled both charges and returned correct
  text and usage.
- Disconnecting a stream after five displayed tokens stopped delivery at six
  transmitted tokens, settled the final invoice, and released the reservation.
- Two requests with an exhausted daily budget created no invoices or payments.
  The current error is a misleading capacity-related HTTP 503; it needs a
  payment-specific explanation.
- Restarting the payer preserved policy, invoices and settled records, and a
  subsequent inference succeeded. Restarting the provider preserved its seller
  prices and financial records.
- Killing the payer after its first output token left a durable output debt.
  Recovery after restart settled the original output invoice without a duplicate
  input debit. QUIC buffered the then-current 256-token cap before detecting the
  dead client, so this crash was billed for 256 transmitted tokens. That test
  predates removal of the payment-specific cap; normal context/caller limits now
  bound that exposure. Neither promises billing only for displayed tokens.
- Explicit wallet sending and replaying the same invoice produced one debit.
- Rejecting manual approval returned HTTP 402 without a debit. The provider then
  denied that peer's next request. Explicitly settling the rejected 1-sat test
  invoice cleared the block, and another paid inference succeeded.
- A free offer remained usable with an exhausted automatic budget. Price changes
  propagated through the normal approximately 60-second heartbeat; the wallet
  control API does not currently trigger immediate price gossip.
- Untrusted Host and Origin headers were refused by the wallet API.

The initial 10,000-sat deposit credited 9,950 sats after a 50-sat receiving fee.
Provider receipts also deducted 0.5%: each 1-sat invoice credited 0.995 sats.
These observations demonstrate the tested Lexe-to-Lexe routes only, not arbitrary
Lightning routing or economical sub-satoshi invoices. The successful test sends
used no outgoing routing fees.

Total outgoing test spending was **21 sats across 14 successful payments**,
including the explicit send and rejected-invoice settlement. All recorded
provider invoices were paid at the end. The payer was returned to manual mode;
both isolated wallet directories were retained, and no wallet credentials or
transaction files are included in the downloadable application bundle.

Lexe's default invoice expiry and recovery from an ambiguous in-flight Lightning
HTLC have not been exercised on mainnet. The crash
test interrupted inference after input settlement, rather than interrupting the
wallet's payment submission. Simulated tests cover uncertain-send recovery and
concurrent reservation enforcement, including resubmission of an unrecorded
attempt, reconciliation without a second `pay`, the expiry give-up, and a
resubmission racing the first landing (`mesh-llm-payments`
`tests/resubmission.rs`). Refunds and proof of computation remain
outside this PoC.

### Follow-up failure and compatibility checks

The following passed without funding new wallets or spending additional bitcoin:

- **Mixed versions:** a released v0.76.1 client received real model output from
  this branch's free provider, and HTTP 402 after that provider enabled paid
  serving. This branch's client also received real model output from the released
  provider. Both directions used separate processes, private meshes, isolated
  profiles, and each binary's matching CPU runtime. Pin
  `runtime.native_runtime.selection = "cpu"`; `--device CPU` alone does not
  prevent the released binary from trying to install a GPU runtime at startup.
- **Concurrent authorization:** 16 simultaneous service requests competed for a
  1,000-msat budget with 700-msat per-request reservations. Exactly one reached
  the simulated wallet. Its 600-msat charge plus 10-msat fee left 300 msat
  available while reserved, then 390 msat after completion.
- **Uncertain HTLC:** simulated payment submission lost its response while the
  wallet retained a pending HTLC. Restart, a status-query outage and invoice
  expiry did not release its reservation or submit a second payment. Separate success
  and failure cases reconciled the original hash, including replay afterward.
- **Expiry:** a real QUIC exchange with a signed, two-second BOLT11 invoice and
  simulated wallets released the waiting backend with zero decoded tokens and
  no output invoice. Approval after expiry never called the wallet. The existing
  policy retains the expired unpaid input invoice in the peer blacklist.
- **Native resource release:** the real SmolLM2 model prefills before approval,
  emits no tokens when the gate reports expiry, and then successfully handles a
  new request on the same single-lane backend.
- **Three-node forwarding:** a remote caller targeting a paid third node could
  not spend an automatically enabled intermediary wallet. Both direct QUIC
  ingress and the legacy loopback bridge returned HTTP 402, with no payer
  records or wallet payment calls. Spoofed loopback `X-Forwarded-For` headers did
  not confer local spending authority.

These faults use controlled wallet responses, not a disrupted mainnet HTLC.
The released CPU archive used for compatibility was
`mesh-llm-v0.76.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`, SHA256
`ea0dbdc83bb85abe31acf7786b84837a17cf238650c2f27636fba4df8c1e7dd2`,
verified against its published checksum. To repeat with extracted product
bundles and the model fixture below:

```sh
python3 scripts/qa-lightning-compatibility.py \
  --current-binary /absolute/current/mesh-bundle/mesh-llm \
  --released-binary /absolute/released/mesh-bundle/mesh-llm \
  --model /absolute/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf \
  --output /absolute/new-evidence-directory

just with-lld cargo test -p mesh-llm-payments --lib
just with-lld cargo test -p mesh-llm-host-runtime --lib payment
```

The script writes results and process logs, stops its own nodes, and leaves its
isolated profiles for inspection. It never calls wallet funding or sending.

Notification coverage also exercises already-settled payments, settlement during
initial lookup, multiple subscribers, unrelated and duplicate events, successful
and failed outgoing payments, incoming expiry, and cancellation followed by
restart. A paused Tokio clock verifies that event-backed waiters perform no
periodic status queries. The QUIC payment fixtures now use event-backed wallets.

Review follow-up coverage adds definite preflight rejection, terminal send
failure, recovery of successful/failed sends without manual request finalization,
prepared-intent recovery, and an uncertain payment temporarily absent from wallet
lookup. It also checks that a failed charge cannot release an uncertain sibling,
already-paid invoices create no phantom approvals (and repair older ones),
invalid/reused send invoices cannot reserve funds, and uninvoiced output debt
blocks the debtor through restart and invoice-creation failures.

Transport regressions reject cross-site loopback requests before wallet or peer
access and cancel a payer only after it has consumed a frame prefix, then verify
the remaining frame and final invoice settle without the recovery loop. The
follow-up wallet suite passes 33 tests and the host payment suite passes 13 tests,
including the existing two-/three-node QUIC fixtures. All-target Clippy passes.
The local CPU product builds and the released/current compatibility smoke cases
pass again. These checks spend no mainnet funds; the mainnet results above are
from the earlier build.

For the opt-in CPU generation test, build this checkout's runtime and set:

```sh
MESH_PAYMENT_TEST_MODEL=/absolute/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf \
MESH_PAYMENT_TEST_RUNTIME="$PWD/target/debug/native-runtimes/meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu" \
just with-lld cargo test -p skippy-server --features dynamic-native-runtime \
  payments_real_model -- --ignored
```

The tested fixture is `unsloth/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-GGUF` revision
`9e6855bc4be717fca1ef21360a1db4b29d5c559a`, file
`SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf`, SHA256
`c4a3dd037301b6ecea31d6da37f5cd793ead920dd5ddfe6d589294628d6ce66a`.
Use only a native bundle built from the same checkout.

For operator-run mainnet validation:

1. Build a current release product using the repository's `just release-build`
   or composed release-bundle instructions. Use two separate config directories
   and distinct management/inference ports (or two machines), each with one
   running node. Join a private mesh using the usual invite flow.
2. Run `wallet --port PORT fund-wallet` on each node. Fund a deliberately small
   allowance and confirm spendable balance and receiving liquidity. Keep both
   wallets' recovery material. Do not infer success from an invoice alone.
3. Serve a small text model on the provider. Get its exact ID from `/v1/models`,
   enable prices, and verify the peer advertisement before requesting inference.
   Use prices large enough for practical mainnet routing during this test.
4. On the payer (client-only), configure automatic policy with an explicit small
   daily budget and request that exact model through the local OpenAI endpoint.
   Verify two settled payments on the payer and two receipts on the provider.
5. Repeat in automatic mode with a small budget. Launch concurrent requests that
   together exceed the budget and verify rejected reservations do not spend.
6. Cancel a streaming request after output begins. Confirm generation stops and
   only transmitted output is invoiced. Restart after an uncertain payment and
   verify the same hash is reconciled without another debit.
7. Verify rejection, invoice expiry, unpaid-peer denial, free-provider fallback,
   remote requests never spending the relay wallet, and a released peer's free
   inference/gossip interoperability. Record hashes/amounts privately as evidence.

## Future encrypted chunks

Later, the inferencer sends an invoice and N tokens encrypted using a key derived
from that invoice's preimage in the same payload. Payment reveals the preimage,
allowing decryption. Bind ciphertext to the request, sequence and invoice, with a
fresh preimage per independently sold chunk. The ledger already identifies
numbered charge segments; token ranges and the cryptographic construction remain
TODO. Preimage-based access does not prove valid inference or honest prefill.

Proof of prefill remains an open [TODO](../../crates/mesh-llm/TODO.md).

## Advertised price visibility

`GET /v1/models` includes an additive `payment` object for concrete model IDs:
`free_available`, `paid_available`, `binding_quote: false`, and `offers` keyed by
`provider_id`. Each offer includes `paid`, nullable `pricing` (input/output
msat-per-million rates and minimum invoice msat), and peer last-seen age. The
age describes peer contact, not a guaranteed quote timestamp. Mixed free/paid
providers remain separate offers. Local advertised seller prices describe remote
service; ordinary local inference does not pay itself. Unknown external-plugin
pricing is not inferred from these offers. Invoice terms remain authoritative.

## Payer-side evidence hooks

`RequestTerms.exchange_id` optionally retains the host's existing OpenAI evidence
exchange ID in the payer's existing JSON terms record. It is not the private
payment recovery ID. Older records omit it; there is no SQL schema migration.
The provider protocol is unchanged.

A trusted local plugin declaring `payment.lifecycle.v1` can observe the active
payer exchange: `terms_accepted`, `input_invoice_issued`,
`input_settlement_observed`, `output_invoice_issued`,
`output_settlement_observed`, and `final_accounted`. Subscribe to
`openai.exchange.v1` as well to obtain the host exchange and join on `exchange_id`.
Events contain `exchange_id`, stable `event_ref`, `terms_digest`, `role` (`payer`
or `provider`), `phase`, `source`, nullable `segment` (0=input, 1=output),
nullable `payment_hash`, nullable `settlement` (`terminal` for wallet success),
`amount_msat`, and nullable `tokens`. A settlement event also carries the
wallet's own numbers when it reported them: `fee_msat` (payer: the fee the
wallet paid on top of `amount_msat`; provider: the fee the receiving wallet
deducted) and, on the provider side, `credited_msat` (what the receiving wallet
reports it credited; Lexe reports it net of the fee). Both are omitted when the
wallet or the `payments.v1` provider did not report them, and both are covered
by `event_ref`. Every payer settlement event now carries `fee_msat`, so its
`event_ref` differs from builds before these members existed.
Terms acceptance is `payer_asserted` (amount is the approved cap); invoice issuance
is `provider_asserted` as observed by the payer, not independently verified
issuance. Settlement is `wallet_reported`, amount excluding fees (the fee is in
`fee_msat`). Final accounting
is `payer_asserted`, summing successful debits including fees. The provider's
own observations are described below; neither side's stream is evidence of the
other's.

The terms digest is lowercase SHA-256 over checked JCS JSON using the existing
host `request_body_digest` helper, applied to the object containing exactly
`exchange_id`, `payee`, `model`, `pricing`, `input_tokens`, `max_output_tokens`,
`max_total_msat`, and `expires_at_ms` (including nulls). Pricing retains its three
named rate/minimum fields. Recovery ID and local peer are excluded. Event refs
use the same construction over the event object with `event_ref` set to `""`.
Integers outside the helper's safe range suppress evidence, not payment.

An eight-event per-exchange queue and one-second publication timeout bound
best-effort delivery. No plugin delivery is awaited by settlement; terms hashing
is skipped without a subscriber. No per-token observation is added. Missing
correlation, disconnects, queue drops, process exits and restart recovery can
leave incomplete evidence; there is no replay or complete audit-log guarantee.
The persisted correlation remains available to recovery tooling, but recovery
currently emits no events. No raw invoice, preimage, wallet transaction ID,
prompt or response text is published. Payment hashes are linkable metadata, and
fee amounts can hint at which wallet a node uses.

## Provider-side evidence hooks

The serving host emits the same `payment.lifecycle.v1` events, with `role:
provider`, at the `payments.v1` seller operations it already calls. Emission is
in the host's serving path, not in the payments engine, so any `payments.v1`
provider gets it unchanged.

| seller operation | phase | source |
|---|---|---|
| `serve_begin` | `terms_accepted` (amount is the terms' cap) | `provider_asserted` |
| `serve_input_invoice` | `input_invoice_issued` | `provider_asserted` |
| `settle_received`, input | `input_settlement_observed` | `wallet_reported` |
| `serve_finish` | `delivered` (`tokens` is the closing watermark, `amount_msat` 0) | `provider_asserted` |
| `output_receivable` | `output_invoice_issued` | `provider_asserted` |
| `settle_received`, output | `output_settlement_observed` | `wallet_reported` |

Observation starts when `serve_input_invoice` returns priced terms, and the
acceptance `serve_begin` made is reported then, just before the input invoice.
A request that fails before that point — including a backend failure before
authorization (`Frame::Error`, no invoice, nothing billed) — emits no phases;
treat that as never priced, not lapsed. `delivered` is emitted once, when the
serving close succeeds, whatever happened to the transport. Settlement is the
receiving wallet's report that `settle_received` recorded; `amount_msat` is the
invoice amount, and `credited_msat` / `fee_msat` are what the receiving wallet
reported (`settle_received` answers them; a provider that answers `{}` leaves
them out). Since the payments engine is a plugin, nothing here claims that
payment preceded wallet access: `source` says who asserted, which is all it can
say.

The request ID is the private recovery ID, so the serving host names each paid
serving request with a fresh `exchange_id` of its own, minted once when a plugin
subscribes to either channel. Its `payment.lifecycle.v1` events and the paid
serving path's `openai.exchange.v1` events both carry it, so a plugin subscribed
to both joins the provider's two channels on `exchange_id`, as on the payer side.
`terms_digest` uses the payer's construction over the provider's terms with that
ID; the other seven fields are the ones the payer approves, but the two sides'
digests differ because each covers its own `exchange_id`. Join the payer's and
the provider's streams on `payment_hash`, which both sides report for each
invoice and settlement.

The payer section's bounds apply unchanged: an eight-event queue per request,
a one-second publication timeout, nothing awaited by serving or settlement, no
per-token events, and no ID or hashing without a subscriber. Evidence is
best-effort and can be incomplete. Lapsed input invoices, recorded debt,
operator unblocking and serving recovery emit no events.


### Evidence interpretation and acceptance expectations

Neither payment nor matching payer/provider records prove correct inference,
honest token counts, or proof of prefill. Wallet settlement is an observation
reported by the configured wallet, not independent verification of inference.

Use synthetic identities and payment hashes in committed fixtures. These are
acceptance expectations, not a claim that every fixture is implemented:

| Scenario | What the evidence should distinguish |
| --- | --- |
| Paid request | Payer and provider observations correlate by payment hash; invoice claims remain distinct from wallet settlement reports. |
| Exhausted automatic budget | Paid request is rejected with HTTP 402, not represented as a successful paid exchange. |
| Free-only policy against a paid-only route | HTTP 402 policy refusal, not a wallet outage or settlement failure. |
| Restart with a pending payment | Reconcile the existing payment without a second debit; successful terminal reconciliation releases its reservation. |
| Harness or observation failure | Preserve the failed attempt and its limitation separately from any corrected rerun; do not silently turn it into a pass. |

Uncertain payments must remain distinguishable from terminal outcomes. Do not
discard unresolved debt merely to report zero outstanding reservations.


### Failure and recovery boundaries

Connection/write failure or a transport drop while awaiting the initial input
invoice can return to ordinary mesh routing before any payment-capable task is
spawned. Provider-reported prefill failure is also retryable at that boundary.
Malformed invoices, invalid terms and policy refusal remain terminal. After the
validated invoice is handed to the payer task, failures remain terminal even if
its payment is still pending: no fallback may create another bill. Client
disconnection during foreground setup drops that setup without spawning a payer.

Background unpaid-input observation reads at most 32 records per batch and
rotates past unpaid/error records, wrapping at the end. This bounds lookup count,
not wallet-call duration. The cursor is in memory; restart begins at the first
record without deleting or forgiving debt.
