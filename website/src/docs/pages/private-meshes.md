# Meshes for Your Own Machines

Use a named mesh to connect your own machines through Nostr discovery. This
is not a private-mesh setup: the name is not an access-control credential.
For an unpublished mesh, start without `--discover` or `--publish` and share its
join token out of band; see the
[token-based setup](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/blob/main/docs/MESHES.md#create-an-unpublished-mesh-and-join-by-token).

Traffic between those Mesh nodes is end-to-end
encrypted by QUIC. If iroh uses a relay, the relay forwards encrypted packets
and cannot read prompts, responses, or split-model activations.

## Discovery and admission

A mesh created without `--publish` is **unpublished**, not necessarily
access-controlled. Named discovery (`--discover`) and public discovery (`--auto`)
are ways to find a mesh; neither defines who is allowed to participate.

A **default join token** supplies endpoint identity and connection addresses,
not bearer authorization. `--join` and `--join-file` can target published or
unpublished meshes. For controlled private deployments, configure and verify
owner/trust policy rather than relying on the mesh name or token secrecy. Signed
bootstrap tokens bind policy but do not by themselves imply owner allowlisting.
See [ownership and admission control](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/blob/main/docs/MESHES.md#ownership-and-admission-control).

## Start the first serving node

```sh
mesh-llm serve --discover my-mesh --model unsloth/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL
```

## Add another serving machine

Install Mesh on the second machine, then use the same mesh name:

```sh
mesh-llm serve --discover my-mesh --model <model-ref>
```

## Join as an API-only client

Use this for a laptop that should send requests but not serve a model:

```sh
mesh-llm client --discover my-mesh
```

## Check that peers are visible

Open the console:

```text
http://localhost:3131
```

Or check status:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:3131/api/status | jq .
```

Named meshes are useful for lab machines, office workstations, or a home cluster where you want your own machines to find each other by name.

## Control an owned node

Mesh membership and private owner-control are separate
boundaries. To manage a model on one remote node you own, read that target's
endpoint token locally and transfer it out of band:

```sh
mesh-llm runtime bootstrap --json
```

From a controlling node authenticated as the same owner:

```sh
mesh-llm runtime load-model \
  --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model '<canonical-model-ref>'
mesh-llm runtime ensure-model \
  --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model '<canonical-model-ref>'
mesh-llm runtime unload-model \
  --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model '<canonical-model-ref>'
mesh-llm runtime drain-model \
  --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --instance-id '<instance-id>'
```

The endpoint token pins exactly one target. These commands travel over
`mesh-llm-control/1`, require same-owner authentication, and create session-only
intents. They do not persist TOML, use public gossip, or silently fall back to
mesh request streams. Public mixed-version join and routing continue
independently; an older target that lacks owner lifecycle support returns a
typed unsupported result.

See [Runtime Lifecycle](/docs/pages/runtime-lifecycle/#owner-control-lifecycle)
for command and drain semantics.
