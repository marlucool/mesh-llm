# Decisions API

`POST /v1/decisions` asks a System One model to answer named questions about
text. A request can combine a yes/no `predicate`, a `choice` from supplied
options, and a numeric `score`. Mesh serves the request through a local or
reachable mesh model; it does not send the input to OpenAI.

## Start and find a model

For a local first run, start the smaller Laya model:

```sh
mesh-llm serve --model meshllm/laya-multilingual-F16-GGUF
```

In another terminal, wait until it appears in `GET /v1/models`, then copy the
exact ID advertised with `system_one`:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9337/v1/models \
  | jq -r '.data[]
      | select(.id != "mesh" and .id != "auto")
      | select((.capabilities // []) | index("system_one"))
      | .id'
```

Use the `/v1/models` response from the same node to which you will send the
decision. A model name without the `system_one` capability is insufficient.
For backend setup and resource requirements, see the [System One API](/docs/pages/system-one-api/).

## Ask three questions

Replace `YOUR_SYSTEM_ONE_MODEL_ID` with a returned ID:

```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9337/v1/decisions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "YOUR_SYSTEM_ONE_MODEL_ID",
    "input": "I was charged twice. Please refund me today.",
    "questions": [
      {"type": "predicate", "name": "urgent", "instructions": "Does this need action today?"},
      {"type": "choice", "name": "team", "instructions": "Which team should handle it?",
       "choices": [{"value": "billing", "description": "Payments and refunds"},
                   {"value": "support", "description": "Technical help"}]},
      {"type": "score", "name": "frustration", "instructions": "How frustrated is the customer?",
       "levels": [{"label": "0", "description": "Calm"},
                  {"label": "1", "description": "Frustrated"},
                  {"label": "2", "description": "Angry"}]}
    ]
  }'
```

The response contains one answer for each question, in request order. This is
an **illustrative shape**; probabilities, scores, and token counts depend on
the model and input:

```json
{
  "model": "YOUR_SYSTEM_ONE_MODEL_ID",
  "answers": [
    {"type": "predicate", "name": "urgent", "probability": 0.875},
    {"type": "choice", "name": "team", "choice": "billing", "probabilities": [
      {"value": "billing", "probability": 0.75},
      {"value": "support", "probability": 0.25}
    ], "confidence": 0.75},
    {"type": "score", "name": "frustration", "score": 1.25, "probabilities": [
      {"value": 0, "label": "0", "probability": 0.125},
      {"value": 1, "label": "1", "probability": 0.5},
      {"value": 2, "label": "2", "probability": 0.375}
    ], "confidence": 0.5}
  ],
  "usage": {"input_tokens": 12, "output_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 12}
}
```

`probability` and `confidence` are numbers from zero to one. For a score,
`score` is numeric while each probability entry carries the option's zero-based
`value` and supplied `label`. `output_tokens` is zero because System One does
not generate text; the usage fields do not represent full compute cost.

## Ask one question

Send a single predicate when you only need a yes/no probability:

```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9337/v1/decisions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"YOUR_SYSTEM_ONE_MODEL_ID","input":"Please refund my duplicate charge today.","questions":[{"type":"predicate","name":"urgent","instructions":"Does this need action today?"}]}'
```

## Request rules and limits

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | Exact ID or alias advertised with `system_one` by this node's `/v1/models`. Automatic model selection is unsupported. |
| `input` | Text string. Images and object input are unsupported in this adapter. |
| `questions` | Nonempty array. Each question needs a distinct, nonempty `name` and a `type` of `predicate`, `choice`, or `score`. |
| `instructions` | Optional text for each question. |
| `choices` | Required for `choice`; each option has a distinct, nonempty string `value` and optional `description`. |
| `levels` | Required for `score`; each level has a distinct, nonempty `label` and optional `description`. The response's numeric `value` is its position in this array. |

The selected System One backend also sets option-count and runtime limits.
See [System One API](/docs/pages/system-one-api/#make-a-read) before using a
large choice or score set. The endpoint returns decisions for the supplied
questions; it does not execute tools or run an agent loop. Standard chat
completion methods in OpenAI SDKs do not call `/v1/decisions`.

## Smoke a running server

From a source checkout, after starting a System One model, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/skippy-decisions-smoke.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:9337
```

The command discovers a capable model, sends all three question types through
HTTP, and checks the response shape. Use `--model <ID>` to select a particular
advertised model. It requires a running Mesh server with a real System One
model; the script's presence does not itself establish a live run.
