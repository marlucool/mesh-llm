# mesh-llm-native-runtime

Shared native runtime manifest, host profile, resolver, cache, and load-plan
policy for MeshLLM.

This crate is the source of truth for selecting native runtimes. CLI install,
SDK serving install, dynamic loading, and autoupdate should all use this same
contract instead of carrying their own CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan detection logic.

## Native Runtimes

A native runtime is a release artifact containing patched llama.cpp/Skippy
shared libraries for one platform/backend lane. The `mesh-llm` binary can stay
one artifact per OS/architecture; native runtimes carry the backend-specific
matrix:

- `cpu`
- `metal`
- `cuda` with a CUDA toolkit major such as 12 or 13
- `rocm` with optional GFX targets
- `vulkan`

Selection is a hard match on four things, and failing any one of them is a
rejection rather than a lower rank: `mesh_version`, `skippy_abi`, platform
(OS, architecture, target triple, minimum glibc), and the backend
requirements the host must satisfy. `resolver.rs` returns the reason as a
structured `CandidateRejection`.

`mesh_version` is not only cache layout. Installed runtimes live under
`<cache-root>/<mesh_version>/<runtime-id>/`, `NativeRuntimeCache::install_manifest`
writes the *manifest's* version into that path, and the prune policy removes
non-active version directories. `mesh-llm-runtime-install` also treats
`mesh_version` and `skippy_abi` together as the single "matches the current
SDK" predicate. A runtime from a different MeshLLM release is therefore not
selectable even when its Skippy ABI matches: it would be installed under a
version directory the running host does not read. Expect a
`MeshVersionMismatch` rejection (`MeshLLM version mismatch: expected X, found
Y`) until the runtime is rebuilt or re-fetched for the host's own version.

## Artifact Manifest

Each packaged runtime directory contains `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "id": "meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cuda13-sm120",
    "mesh_version": "0.77.0",
    "skippy_abi": "0.1.25",
    "platform": {
      "os": "linux",
      "arch": "x86_64",
      "target": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
      "min_glibc": "2.38"
    },
    "backend": {
      "kind": "cuda",
      "cuda": {
        "toolkit_major": 13,
        "min_driver": "580.0",
        "gpu_arches": ["sm_120"]
      }
    },
    "rank": 0,
    "libraries": [
      "lib/libcudart.so.13",
      "lib/libcublasLt.so.13",
      "lib/libcublas.so.13",
      "lib/libllama.so"
    ]
  }
}
```

CPU uses:

```json
"backend": { "kind": "cpu" }
```

ROCm uses:

```json
"backend": {
  "kind": "rocm",
  "rocm": {
    "version": "6.4",
    "gpu_arches": ["gfx1100"]
  }
}
```

Important fields:

- `id`: stable runtime ID used for explicit selection and cache paths.
- `skippy_abi`: exact ABI version required by the loader.
- `platform`: OS/arch/optional Rust target triple.
- `platform.min_glibc`: observed minimum glibc major.minor required by packaged Linux ELF libraries and tools. Older release manifests may omit it and remain parseable for legacy catalog resolution, but automatic startup refuses to load a locally installed Linux artifact without this metadata.
- `backend`: structured backend requirements.
- `rank`: optional rank adjustment. Higher compatible ranks win.
- `libraries`: runtime-relative load-order library paths. Linux CUDA manifests
  list the redistributable toolkit closure before `libllama.so`; the NVIDIA
  driver library (`libcuda.so.1`) remains host-owned. Redistributed NVIDIA
  objects remain byte-for-byte unchanged and the artifact includes the CUDA
  distribution license under `licenses/`.
- `url` and `sha256`: populated in release manifests for downloads.

## Release Manifest

Release jobs publish `native-runtimes.json`:

```json
{
  "mesh_version": "0.77.0",
  "skippy_abi": "0.1.25",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu",
      "mesh_version": "0.77.0",
      "skippy_abi": "0.1.25",
      "platform": { "os": "linux", "arch": "x86_64" },
      "backend": { "kind": "cpu" },
      "rank": 0,
      "libraries": ["lib/libllama.so"],
      "url": "https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/releases/download/v0.77.0/meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu.tar.gz",
      "sha256": "2f1c..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Host Profile

Selection evaluates artifacts against `HostRuntimeProfile`:

```rust
use mesh_llm_native_runtime::{
    HostCudaProfile, HostRuntimeProfile, NativeRuntimeBackendKind,
};
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

let profile = HostRuntimeProfile {
    os: "linux".to_string(),
    arch: "x86_64".to_string(),
    target_triple: Some("x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu".to_string()),
    glibc_version: Some("2.39".to_string()),
    available_flavors: BTreeSet::from([
        NativeRuntimeBackendKind::Cpu,
        NativeRuntimeBackendKind::Cuda,
    ]),
    gpus: Vec::new(),
    cuda: Some(HostCudaProfile {
        toolkit_majors: BTreeSet::from([12]),
        driver_max_major: Some(12),
        driver_version: None,
        gpu_arches: BTreeSet::from(["sm_90".to_string()]),
    }),
    rocm: None,
    vulkan: None,
};
```

`mesh-llm-hardware-profile` builds this profile for real hosts. It supports
explicit environment overrides for CI/release testing, including
`MESH_LLM_CUDA_TOOLKIT_MAJOR`, `MESH_LLM_CUDA_TOOLKIT_MAJORS`,
`MESH_LLM_CUDA_DRIVER_MAX_MAJOR`, `MESH_LLM_CUDA_GPU_ARCHES`,
`MESH_LLM_ROCM_GPU_ARCHES`, and `MESH_LLM_VULKAN_AVAILABLE`.

### CUDA toolkit vs driver

`toolkit_majors` and `driver_max_major` are deliberately separate:

- `toolkit_majors` — CUDA majors whose runtime libraries are actually installed
  (probed from `libcudart.so.<major>` sonames and `/usr/local/cuda-<version>`).
- `driver_max_major` — the newest CUDA the installed driver supports, from
  `nvidia-smi`. This is an upper bound only.

Linux CUDA native runtimes bundle the redistributable `libcudart`, `libcublas`,
`libcublasLt`, and their toolkit dependency closure. The NVIDIA driver library
(`libcuda.so.1`) remains host-owned. Windows runtimes likewise ship their
redistributable toolkit DLLs, so both platforms can load on a driver-only host
when the driver is new enough to run the selected toolkit major.

The resolver prefers a matching installed toolkit when one is present, but a
complete self-contained artifact can use the driver's maximum supported major.
A CUDA 13 driver with a CUDA 12 toolkit therefore chooses cuda12; a driver-only
host can choose cuda13 when the packaged artifact contains the CUDA 13 closure.

## Resolution

Use `NativeRuntimeResolver` when the caller needs both the selected artifact and
where it should come from:

```rust
use mesh_llm_native_runtime::{
    NativeRuntimeCache, NativeRuntimeReleaseManifest, NativeRuntimeResolver,
    RuntimeSelection,
};
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn example(
#     profile: mesh_llm_native_runtime::HostRuntimeProfile,
#     manifest: NativeRuntimeReleaseManifest,
# ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let cache = NativeRuntimeCache::new("/tmp/mesh-llm/native-runtimes");
let resolution = NativeRuntimeResolver::new("0.77.0", profile, manifest, cache)
    .with_skippy_abi_version("0.1.25")
    .with_bundle_dirs(vec![PathBuf::from("./meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu")])
    .resolve(&RuntimeSelection::Recommended)?;

println!("selected {}", resolution.selected.id);
# Ok(())
# }
```

Selection strings accepted by `RuntimeSelection::parse`:

- `recommended`
- `cpu`
- `metal`
- `cuda`
- `cuda12`
- `cuda13`
- `rocm`
- `vulkan`
- `exact:<runtime-id>`

Compatibility checks:

- exact Skippy ABI
- OS/arch/target triple
- Linux glibc version when both the artifact requirement and host detection are known
- automatic startup requires glibc metadata on locally installed Linux artifacts
- backend kind support
- CUDA toolkit major
- CUDA SM architecture
- ROCm GFX architecture
- Vulkan availability
- explicit selection policy

Every candidate is returned in `NativeRuntimeResolution::evaluated` with
structured rejection reasons for `mesh-llm runtime list`, `mesh-llm doctor`, SDK
diagnostics, and support output.

## Cache Layout

Installed runtimes are stored under:

```text
<cache-root>/<mesh_version>/<runtime-id>/
  manifest.json
  lib/...
```

`mesh_version` remains part of the cache layout and prune policy so upgrading
MeshLLM can install the newly selected runtime, switch to it, and remove older
runtime caches after success.

## Load Plan Boundary

This crate does not load dynamic libraries. `InstalledNativeRuntime::load_plan`
validates `runtime.libraries` and returns absolute paths for the Skippy FFI
loader:

```rust
# fn example(installed: mesh_llm_native_runtime::InstalledNativeRuntime) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let plan = installed.load_plan()?;
for library in plan.libraries {
    println!("load {}", library.display());
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Packaging

Package and verify a runtime:

```bash
scripts/package-native-runtime.sh \
  --build \
  --backend cuda \
  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
  --out dist/native-runtimes

scripts/verify-native-runtime-package.sh dist/native-runtimes/*.tar.gz
```

Linux runtime packages must be relocatable from the installed cache. MeshLLM's
ELF shared libraries use `$ORIGIN` in their runtime search path so sibling
libraries under `lib/` resolve without requiring users, CI, or SDK smoke tests
to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Redistributed NVIDIA libraries are loaded first from
their manifest paths and remain byte-for-byte unchanged. The package verifier
rejects absolute build or CI `RPATH`/`RUNPATH` entries and proves that the
declared dependency-first load plan closes every packaged CUDA dependency while
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is absent.

CUDA lanes use `MESH_LLM_CUDA_TOOLKIT_MAJOR` to emit IDs such as `cuda12` or
`cuda13`. `--backend cuda-blackwell` defaults to `cuda13-sm120`.

Generate the release manifest:

```bash
scripts/generate-native-runtime-release-manifest.sh \
  --tag v0.77.0 \
  --out dist/native-runtimes/native-runtimes.json \
  dist/native-runtimes/*.tar.gz
```
