//! Task 4 acceptance: every delivery class (terminal, state-transition,
//! progress, diagnostic) is applied through the reducer and published,
//! coalescing is per `(OperationScope, kind)` -- never globally by kind --
//! and the ONE shared engine-level ingress-sequence counter (`wake.rs`) is
//! consumed by every submit outcome, so a coalesced/dropped/failed input
//! leaves a permanent gap in the published sequence space rather than
//! silently vanishing. Fixes review defect D2
//! (`.omo/plans/event-system-fixes.md` task 4): before this module,
//! `engine::drain` only ever processed the terminal wake list, so state,
//! progress, and diagnostic facts were accepted at the lane but never
//! reached the reducer or a subscriber.
