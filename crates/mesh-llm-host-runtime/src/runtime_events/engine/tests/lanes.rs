//! Lane behavior, asserted on what publishes rather than on what a
//! producer is told.
//!
//! Coalescing and depth used to be producer-visible: a repeat key came
//! back `Coalesced`, and a full lane came back `DroppedDiagnostic`,
//! because both decisions were made inside the admission gate. They are
//! made in the consumer now, so a producer is simply told its fact was
//! accepted. The behavior itself is unchanged and is asserted here on the
//! published stream, which is what a consumer actually sees.
