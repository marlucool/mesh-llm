//! Drain-owned lane state.
//!
//! Delivery classes used to be separated at the producer boundary: four
//! bounded containers, each with its own mutex, each written by whichever
//! thread happened to be emitting an event. That is what made a producer
//! wait on a lane, and what forced the drain to reconstruct a total order
//! across four containers under a shared gate.
//!
//! Now all four classes arrive through one ring in submission order, and
//! this module is the consumer-side state that remains. Only a drain pass
//! touches it, serialized by `drain_gate`, so it needs no producer-visible
//! locking of its own:
//!
//! * **Terminal** and **diagnostic** facts pass straight through in the
//!   pass that popped them. Neither accumulates.
//! * **State transitions** coalesce per `(OperationScope, kind)` within a
//!   pass. A repeated key keeps the newest value at the newest position,
//!   because the newest value is what a consumer wants and the newest
//!   position is where it actually arrived.
//! * **Progress** is the only class that persists across passes: one
//!   latest value per operation, exported at most once per
//!   `PROGRESS_EXPORT_INTERVAL`. Everything in between is a superseded
//!   snapshot and is counted as `coalesced_progress` rather than published;
//!   it is not loss, because the newest value still publishes.
