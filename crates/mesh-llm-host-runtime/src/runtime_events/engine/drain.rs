//! Pop the ingress ring in submission order and apply each fact through
//! the transactional reducer: only an accepted fact appends a replay frame
//! and fans out to subscribers, so a rejected input never appears on the
//! stream.
//!
//! ## Why this is short now
//!
//! It used to have to rebuild a total order. Four bounded containers were
//! written by producers under a shared gate that also minted the sequence,
//! and a pass had to select one global sequence prefix across all four,
//! drain each to that boundary, merge, and sort -- while holding the gate
//! every producer needed.
//!
//! With one ring there is nothing to reconstruct. Pop order is submission
//! order, and a sequence is assigned when a fact publishes, so the
//! published order is the pop order by construction. `collect_sequence_prefix`,
//! the per-lane `drain_before_limit` cutoffs, the full-table progress scan,
//! and the merge-and-sort are all gone with it, and a pass holds nothing a
//! producer ever takes.
//!
//! ## What a pass does
//!
//! 1. Pop up to `max` items, returning ring credits as it goes.
//! 2. Route by class ([`super::lanes`]): terminals, state transitions, and
//!    diagnostics into this pass's batch; progress into the one lane that
//!    persists, to be exported on its own 100 ms cadence.
//! 3. Apply the batch in arrival order, assigning each published fact the
//!    next sequence.
//! 4. Release the slot of each terminal that applied, and evict its
//!    reducer state -- after every fact in the pass has applied, so
//!    eviction cannot race an application that would re-create the entry.
//!
//! A root whose own terminal has drained but which still has occupied
//! children has only its *slot release* deferred ([`release_or_defer`]),
//! bounded by [`settle_pending_root_releases`]'s `CHILD_SETTLE_GRACE`. Its
//! terminal still applies and publishes immediately. Force-releasing the
//! children instead would reject their real, still-in-flight terminals as
//! stale moments later.

// Task 8-fix E1 (`.omo/plans/event-system-fixes.md`): the engine-level
// proof that `apply_and_publish_fact` above credits every frame a single
// `ReplayBuffer::push` evicts, not one bump per push. `engine/mod.rs` has
// no production seam to shrink the replay buffer's `max_age` below the
// frozen 300s `REPLAY_MAX_AGE` (and task 8-fix's grant does not extend to
// adding one there), so `engine_with_tiny_replay_age` below builds a
// `RuntimeEventEngine` by struct literal -- every field matches
// `RuntimeEventEngine::with_capacities` exactly except `replay`, which
// uses a millisecond-scale age bound so the test can force a genuine
// same-push multi-eviction without a real 300s wait.
//
// Task 9 CORRECTION (`.omo/plans/event-system-fixes.md`, defect D11): this
// comment used to claim "only the age dimension can [evict more than one
// frame per push]; the count/byte dimensions can never... since each
// push's own eviction loop already restores the invariant before the next
// push can violate it again" -- true of the COUNT dimension always, and
// was true of the BYTE dimension only while `ReplayBuffer` charged every
// frame the same fixed `APPROX_FRAME_BYTE_COST`. Task 9 replaced that
// fixed cost with each frame's REAL, variable pre-serialized wire-byte
// length (`replay::ReplayFrame::wire_bytes`), so the byte dimension can
// now ALSO evict more than one frame per push -- proven at the
// `ReplayBuffer` level (not here; see the ownership note below) by
// `replay::tests::a_single_large_frame_can_evict_multiple_smaller_frames_via_the_byte_bound`.
// The test below still isolates the AGE dimension specifically
// (`max_bytes: usize::MAX` means the byte bound can never fire here), so
// it remains a valid, UNCHANGED proof of age-driven multi-eviction; it is
// simply no longer the only dimension capable of it.
//
// This is legal because `engine::drain::tests` is a descendant module of
// `engine`, where every field of `RuntimeEventEngine` is defined
// (module-private, not `pub`) -- the same visibility rule that already
// lets this file's own `apply_and_publish_fact` read
// `self.replay`/`self.health` directly.
