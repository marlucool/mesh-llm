//! Host runtime-event engine: bounded slot-owned terminal ingress, the
//! minimal acknowledgement seam a reducer drains, bounded replay, bounded
//! in-process subscribers, coalesced health, and deterministic shutdown.
//!
//! Built on the dependency-leaf contracts in `mesh-llm-runtime-event-contracts`
//! (facts, identity, delivery classification, `RuntimeEventIngress`). This
//! module owns admission, the reservation table (the only terminal channel),
//! and the frozen bounds from the plan's engine-bounds table. State
//! reduction semantics (ordering, degradation policy, rebuild policy beyond
//! the minimal ack seam) belong to a later task.
