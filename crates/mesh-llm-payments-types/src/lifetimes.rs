//! Host-owned invoice lifetimes and payment wait deadlines.
//!
//! The wallet contract requires the caller to state how long an invoice stays
//! payable (`WalletProvider::create_invoice(.., expiry_secs)`); no provider
//! default is ever used. Expiry is a safety bound enforced by the payee's node:
//! an HTLC for an expired invoice is rejected, so a late payment fails at the
//! payer instead of landing after the seller has given up. The seller's wait
//! for an input payment therefore runs for exactly the invoice lifetime: a
//! payer cannot cancel an in-flight HTLC, so any moment where the seller has
//! stopped waiting but its node would still claim the payment is a window in
//! which the payer pays for output that has already been discarded.
