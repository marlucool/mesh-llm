//! L3 exact-state segment store.
//!
//! The durable tier under the radix cache: exported continuation state is cut
//! into content-addressed segments and committed under a manifest that records
//! ordering and completeness. Disk (this module) and the network handoff
//! stream are backends of the same contract:
//!
//! - **Segment identity**: every segment is addressed by the BLAKE3 digest of
//!   its bytes; reads verify the digest, so corruption is detected, never
//!   silently imported.
//! - **Ordering**: the manifest lists segments with explicit index/offset;
//!   assembly validates both.
//! - **Completeness**: a manifest only commits after every referenced segment
//!   is present and the assembled payload digest matches. Partial state can
//!   never be loaded — there is nothing to load until commit.
//! - **Idempotency**: putting a segment that already exists is a no-op;
//!   concurrent writers of the same bytes converge on one object via
//!   temp-file + atomic rename.
//! - **Capped budget**: `enforce_budget` evicts oldest manifests first (the
//!   newest is never evicted) and garbage-collects unreferenced segments.
