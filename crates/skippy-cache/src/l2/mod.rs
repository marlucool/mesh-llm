//! Host-RAM L2 tier over the packed L3 segment format (#1651).
//!
//! The radix cache (L1) holds resident payloads; the L3 tier holds the same
//! state durably on disk as content-addressed packed segments. This module
//! adds the missing middle tier: a bounded host-RAM cache of *immutable
//! packed segments*, keyed and identified exactly like the L3 entries they
//! mirror.
//!
//! Contract (mirrors `crate::tier::L3Tier`):
//!
//! - **Identity**: entries are stamped with the tier's model and exact-state
//!   identities. The cache key includes the identities, so a re-identity is
//!   a wholesale miss, never a silent hit.
//! - **Coordinates**: entries are keyed by the same
//!   `(namespace, token path)` coordinates L3 uses —
//!   [`crate::tier::l3_prefix_key`] / [`crate::tier::l3_namespace_key`] — so
//!   an L2 hit is interchangeable with the L3 entry it cached.
//! - **Segment sharing**: an entry stores immutable `Arc<Vec<u8>>` segment
//!   handles keyed by their content digests plus a layout that maps the
//!   entry's L3 manifest segment list onto those handles. A longer prefix
//!   that extends a shorter one references the same segment handles, so
//!   turn growth shares prefix bytes instead of duplicating them — L2 RAM
//!   tracks *distinct segment* bytes, not per-prefix assembled bytes.
//! - **Integrity**: the whole concatenated L3 wire digest (the manifest key)
//!   is verified exactly once, at admission, against the payload being
//!   admitted. After admission the segment bytes are immutable, so every
//!   later read is a digest lookup plus handle assembly — no re-hash. An
//!   admission-time mismatch refuses the insert; L2 never holds bytes it
//!   did not verify.
//! - **Bounded**: the byte budget is charged with each entry's *distinct*
//!   segment bytes (bytes not already held by an in-flight insert) and
//!   enforced by evicting in deterministic LRU order. A payload whose
//!   distinct bytes exceed the whole budget is refused. A segment shared
//!   with an already-admitted entry is shared for accounting too: only the
//!   first admission pays for it.
//! - **Zero-copy reads**: `get` clones handles, not bytes; the returned
//!   `CacheBytes` is a block-backed view over the shared segment storages,
//!   contiguous in the single-segment case.
//!
//! `skippy-server` wires this tier as a bounded mirror of repeated or
//! high-value L3 fills. An L2 hit rewarms L1.
