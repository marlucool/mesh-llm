//! Benefit-per-exclusive-byte admission, probation, and eviction policy
//! (issue #1650, first slice).
//!
//! This module is deliberately a *pure policy*: it consumes observed events
//! (candidate offers, hits, misses, cost samples) and produces decisions
//! (admit / probation / persist / evict) with opaque reasons. It performs no
//! I/O, holds no locks on the restore path, and never sees prompt content —
//! entries are addressed by an opaque `EntryKey` the caller assigns.
//!
//! The score is the one the issue prescribes:
//!
//! ```text
//! reuse_probability * max(cold_prefill_cost - restore_cost, 0)
//! -----------------------------------------------------------
//!                exclusive_physical_bytes
//! ```
//!
//! Shared segments are credited fractionally: a physical byte referenced by
//! N entries counts as `bytes / N` against each of them, so total accounted
//! bytes never double-count a segment.
//!
//! Determinism: every ordering falls back to `(score, entry_key)` so two runs
//! over the same trace make identical decisions.
