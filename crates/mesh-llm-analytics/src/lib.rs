#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Anonymous, opt-out product analytics for mesh-llm.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A narrow PostHog reporter for questions we cannot answer any other way:
//! which platforms mesh-llm runs on, which commands people actually use,
//! whether `serve` sessions survive, and how big real meshes get.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! It is not the `[telemetry]` config section. That one is operator-facing
//! OTLP: the operator points it at *their own* collector and nothing leaves
//! their network. This crate is the only code in mesh-llm that reports to a
//! vendor, and it is deliberately kept in one reviewable place.
//!
//! # Design constraints
//!
//! - **Closed vocabulary.** [`Event`] and [`Properties`] admit no free-form
//!   `String`. Text only enters through [`Label::sanitize`], whose grammar
//!   rejects paths, prose, and anything over-long. A prompt cannot reach the
//!   wire through this API even by mistake.
//! - **No key, no reporting.** The project key is compiled in by the release
//!   pipeline. Source and development builds have none and are inert.
//! - **Never load-bearing.** Capture is non-blocking, delivery is best
//!   effort, and no failure here changes a command's behavior or exit code.
//! - **Anonymous by construction.** The identifier is a random UUID with no
//!   derivation from the machine, and it is not the published mesh identity.
