//! The last build version this install reported under.
//!
//! An upgrade is invisible to every other signal here. `install_first_run`
//! fires once and never again, and `serve_started` carries the current
//! version but says nothing about what came before it — so an install that
//! upgraded and one that never moved look identical unless it happens to
//! serve. Recording the last-seen version turns that into an explicit
//! [`Event::InstallUpdated`](crate::Event::InstallUpdated).
//!
//! Comparing against stored state rather than hooking the updater is what
//! makes this cover every route a new binary can arrive by: `--auto-update`,
//! `mesh-llm update`, a re-run of `install.sh`, a package manager, or a
//! hand-swapped binary. The updater does not have to cooperate, and a process
//! that `exec`s itself away mid-update does not have to deliver anything: the
//! next run observes the change and reports it with a normal lifetime and a
//! normal flush.
//!
//! # Reporting exactly once
//!
//! The transition is a read-compare-write across processes, and an upgrade
//! must produce one `install_updated`, not none and not several. Three things
//! hold that together:
//!
//! - **A lock.** Several mesh-llm processes can start at once after an
//!   upgrade. Without a lock each would read the old version and each would
//!   report the same transition. The read and the write happen under one
//!   exclusive lock on the state directory, and a process that cannot take it
//!   reports nothing rather than racing.
//! - **An atomic replace.** The record is written to a temporary file and
//!   renamed over the old one, so a crash mid-write leaves the previous
//!   version intact instead of a truncated file that reads as no record.
//! - **Commit before report.** [`PendingVersion::commit`] returns whether the
//!   record now actually reflects this build, and the caller only reports the
//!   upgrade when it does. A write that failed leaves the old version in
//!   place, so the next run sees the same transition again and can retry —
//!   the opposite of the old behaviour, which reported a change it had failed
//!   to persist and then reported it again on every subsequent run.
