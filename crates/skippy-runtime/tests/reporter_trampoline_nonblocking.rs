//! The two properties the native reporter callback has to have.
//!
//! It fires on whichever native worker thread raised the event -- a decode
//! thread, a loader thread, a device monitor. So:
//!
//! 1. **It never waits on a consumer.** Not when the ring is empty, not
//!    when it is full, not when another native thread is pushing at the
//!    same time. A decode thread stalling to report a diagnostic is the
//!    failure this boundary exists to prevent.
//! 2. **It never allocates.** An allocation can take a global lock inside
//!    the allocator, which is a stall by another name, and it is the exact
//!    cost the old path paid -- it copied every detail byte into a `Vec` on
//!    the callback thread before doing anything else.
//!
//! A separate integration binary because it installs a counting global
//! allocator, which would otherwise instrument every other test in the
//! crate.
