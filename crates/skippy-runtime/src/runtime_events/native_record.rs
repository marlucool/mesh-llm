//! A `Copy` snapshot of one native runtime event.
//!
//! The reporter callback runs on whichever native worker thread raised the
//! event -- a decode thread, a loader thread, a device monitor. Whatever it
//! does there, that thread is not doing its real work. So it does exactly
//! two things: copy the event onto the stack, and push it into a ring.
//!
//! That rules out [`super::RuntimeEvent`] as the callback-thread type. It
//! owns its detail bytes in a `Vec`, so building one allocates, and it is
//! not `Copy`, so moving it around is not free either. [`NativeEventRecord`]
//! is plain data with the detail inlined: constructing it is a fixed-size
//! memcpy with no branch that can allocate.
//!
//! ## Detail truncation
//!
//! Native detail is bounded at a megabyte by the ABI, which is far too
//! large to inline. A record carries the first [`INLINE_DETAIL_BYTES`] and
//! records that it truncated. That is a deliberate trade: detail is
//! diagnostic prose, the consumer already bounds what it puts on the wire,
//! and a truncation flag is information the old path did not have at all --
//! it copied the whole thing and then let the consumer silently bound it.
//!
//! ## Scalars stay raw
//!
//! Every enum-like field is kept as the raw integer the ABI delivered and
//! converted by [`NativeEventRecord::to_event`] on the consumer side. A
//! conversion is a branch, and a branch on the callback thread is work that
//! does not have to happen there.
