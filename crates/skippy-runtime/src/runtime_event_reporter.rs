//! The process-global runtime-scoped event reporter.
//!
//! The native reporter callback fires on whichever worker thread raised
//! the event -- a decode thread, a loader thread, a device monitor. That
//! thread is doing real work, and every instruction it spends here is
//! stolen from it.
//!
//! So the callback does one thing: copy the event into a
//! [`NativeEventRecord`] on the stack and push it into a bounded lock-free
//! ring. No mutex, no allocation, no notify, no conversion. A consumer
//! calls [`drain_runtime_events`] on its own schedule and pays for all of
//! that there.
//!
//! It used to call an installed `Box<dyn FnMut>` sink inline, under a
//! mutex, and that sink went on to take an identity-registry lock,
//! allocate several owned strings, reserve a slot, and submit -- all on the
//! native worker's thread, with the sink mutex held for the whole of it.
//! Two callbacks from different native threads serialized on that mutex
//! against each other and against every install or clear.
//!
//! ## Loss is bounded and counted
//!
//! The ring holds [`RECORD_RING_CAPACITY`] records. A push into a full
//! ring drops the record and increments [`dropped_runtime_events`], which
//! is the honest behavior for this boundary: the alternative is making a
//! decode thread wait for a consumer, which is the thing this file exists
//! to prevent. Native events are diagnostic observations, and the runtime
//! event contract already requires consumers to tolerate missing progress
//! and diagnostic events.
