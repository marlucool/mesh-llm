//! What a wallet plugin author implements.
//!
//! A [`WalletBackend`] is a factory over a concrete wallet: it
//! opens persisted state under a host-supplied directory and hands back a
//! [`WalletProvider`] plus its [`WalletIdentity`]. Everything else — the
//! operation router, error mapping, open-state tracking — is provided by
//! [`crate::plugin_server`].
