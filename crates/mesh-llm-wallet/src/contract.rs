//! The `wallet.v1` plugin capability contract.
//!
//! A wallet plugin advertises [`CAPABILITY`] in its manifest and serves the
//! operations below over the ordinary plugin operation transport. The host
//! resolves the provider by capability, never by plugin name, so any plugin
//! that speaks this contract can back paid inference.
//!
//! Every shape here is additive JSON: unknown fields are ignored on both
//! sides, and new optional fields may be added without a version bump.
//! Renaming or removing a field, or changing an operation's semantics, is a
//! `wallet.v2`.
//!
//! The host, not the plugin, owns token metering, output gating, the ledger,
//! budgets, settlement bookkeeping, invoice lifetimes and fee caps. The plugin
//! only turns wallet intents into wallet facts: invoices, payments, balances
//! and settlement observation.
