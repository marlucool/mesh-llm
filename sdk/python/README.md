# MeshLLM Python SDK

The `mesh-llm` package embeds a Mesh client directly in Python. It is designed
for agent runtimes such as Hermes that need private inference without managing
a loopback HTTP sidecar.

```bash
pip install mesh-llm
```

```python
import asyncio
import os

from meshllm import Client, generate_owner_keypair_hex


async def main() -> None:
    owner = generate_owner_keypair_hex()
    # Public Mesh: discover and connect to the best published mesh.
    client = await Client.connect_public(owner_keypair_hex=owner)
    # Private Mesh instead:
    # client = Client.create(
    #     owner_keypair_hex=owner,
    #     invite_token=os.environ["MESH_INVITE_TOKEN"],
    # )
    async with client:
        response = await client.inference.chat_completions({
            "model": "Qwen3-8B",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather?"}],
            "tools": [{
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "get_weather",
                    "description": "Get the weather for a city",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
                        "required": ["city"],
                    },
                },
            }],
        })
        print(response["choices"][0]["message"])


asyncio.run(main())
```

`chat_completions()` and `responses()` use the protocol-preserving request
path: the SDK serializes the mapping without narrowing it to text-only fields
and returns the full response object. Their streaming counterparts preserve
the full OpenAI-compatible SSE contract, including incremental tool-call
arguments, reasoning, usage, and provider-specific fields:

```python
from meshllm import OpenAIStreamChunk

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the weather for a city",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["city"],
        },
    },
}]

async for event in client.inference.stream_chat_completions({
    "model": "Qwen3-8B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Call the weather tool."}],
    "tools": tools,
}):
    if isinstance(event, OpenAIStreamChunk) and not event.done:
        chunk = event.json()
        print(chunk)  # includes text, reasoning, and tool-call deltas unchanged
```

Use `stream_responses()` for the Responses API, or `stream(path, body)` for
another OpenAI-compatible SSE endpoint. Closing an iterator cancels the native
request and interrupts an in-flight transport read.

`list_models()` returns each model's actual served `context_length` when the
Mesh advertises it. Agent runtimes should budget against that value rather than
the model architecture's theoretical maximum; legacy servers may return
`None`.

## Building from a checkout

Generate bindings and stage the current-platform native library:

```bash
sdk/python/scripts/generate-python-bindings.sh
sdk/python/scripts/build-native.sh
python3 -m pip install -e sdk/python
```

Set `MESH_PYTHON_EMBEDDED_RUNTIME=1` before `build-native.sh` to include local
model serving. Client-only builds are smaller and are sufficient for Hermes.

The generated Python source is committed. Release wheels additionally package
the matching `libuniffi` native library beside it for macOS, Linux, or Windows.
